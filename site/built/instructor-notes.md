title: Instructor Notes
---

This is a placeholder designed to get the lesson running. Below are notes from another lesson.

## Timing

Leave about 30 minutes at the start of each workshop and another 15 mins
at the start of each session for technical difficulties like WiFi and
installing things (even if you asked students to install in advance, longer if
not).

## Lesson Plans

The lesson contains much more material than can be taught in a day.
Instructors will need to pick an appropriate subset of episodes to use
in a standard one day course.
