# Building a Corpus

## Text data sources

The best sources of text datasets will ultimately depend on the goals of your project. Some common sources of text data for text analysis include digitized archival materials, newspapers, books, social media, and research articles. For the most part, the datasets and sources you may come across will not have been arranged with a particular project in mind. The burden is therefore on you, as the researcher, to evaluate whether materials are suitable for your corpus. It can be useful to create a list of criteria for how you will decide what to include in your corpus. You may get the best results by piecing together your corpus from materials from various sources that meet your requirements. This will help you to create an intellectually rigorous corpus that meets your project's needs and makes a unique contribution to your area of study. 

##Text Data and Restrictions

One of the most important criteria for inclusion in your corpus that you should consider is whether or not you have the right to use the data in the way your project requires. When evaluating data sources for your project, you may need to navigate a variety of legal and ethical issues. We’ll briefly mention some of them below, but to learn more about these issues, we recommend the open access book[ Building Legal Literacies for Text and Data Mining](https://berkeley.pressbooks.pub/buildinglltdm/). 


*   **Copyright** - Copyright law in the United States protects original works of authorship and grants the right to reproduce the work, to create derivative works, distribute copies, perform the work publicly, and to share the work publicly. Fair use may create exceptions for some TDM activities, but if you are analyzing copyrighted material, publicly sharing your full text corpus would likely be in violation of copyright. 
*   **Licensing** - Licenses grant permission to use materials in certain ways while usually restricting others. If you are working with databases or other licensed collections of materials, make sure that you understand the license and how it applies to text and data mining. 
*   **Terms of Use** - If you are collecting text data from other sources, such as websites or applications, make sure that you understand any retrictions on how the data can be used. 
*   **Technology Protection Measures** - Some publishers and content hosts protect their copyrighted/licensed materials through encryption. While commercial versions of ebooks, for example, would make for easy content to analyze, circumventing these protections would be illegal in the United States under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 
*   **Privacy** - Before sharing a corpus publicly, consider whether doing so would constitute any legal or ethical violations, especially with regards to privacy. Consulting with digital scholarship librarians at your university or professional organizations in your field would be a good place to learn about privacy issues that might arise with the type of data you are working with. 
*   **Research Protections** - Depending on the type of corpus you are creating, you might need to consider human subject research protections such as informed consent. Your institution’s Institutional Review Board may be able to help you navigate emerging issues surrounding text data that is publicly available but could be sensitive, such as social media data. 




##OCR and Speech Transcription

Another criteria you may have to consider is the format that you need your files to be in. It may be that your test documents are not in text format- that is, in a file format that can be copied and pasted into a notepad file. Not all data is of this type, for example, there may be documents that are stored as image files or sound files. Or perhaps your documents are in PDF or DOC files. 

Fortunately, there exist tools to convert file types like these into text. While these tools are beyond the scope of our lesson, they are still worth mentioning. Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a field of study that converts images to text. Tools such as Tesseract, Amazon Textract, or Google’s Document AI can perform OCR tasks. Speech transcription will take audio files and convert them to text as well. Google’s Speech-to-Text and Amazon Transcribe are two cloud solutions for speech transcription.

Later in this lesson we will be working with OCR text data that has been generated from images of digitized newspapers. As you will see, the quality of text generated by OCR and speech to text software can vary. In order to include a document with imperfect OCR text, you may decide to do some file clean up or remediation. Or you may decide to only include documents with a certain level of OCR accuracy in your corpus. 


## Using APIs

When searching through sources, you may come across instructions to access the data through an API. An API, or application programming interface, allows computer programs to talk to one another. In the context of the digital humanities, you can use an API to request and receive specific data from corpora created by libraries, museums, or other cultural organizations or data creators. 

There are different types of APIs, but for this lesson, we will be working with a RESTful API, which uses HTTP, or hypertext protocol methods. A RESTful API can be used to post, delete, and get data. You can make a request using a URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, which is sent to a web server using HTTP and returns a response. If you piece together a URL in a certain way, it will give the web server all the info it needs to locate what you are looking for and it will return the correct response. If that sounds familiar, it’s because this is how we access websites everyday! 

###A few things to keep in mind: 

*   Each API will be different, so you will always want to check their documentation. 
*   Some APIs will require that you register to receive an API key in order to access their data. 
*   Just because the data is being made available through an API, doesn’t mean that it can be used in your particular project. Remember to check the terms of use. 
*   Check the data - even if you’ve used the API before. What format will it be delivered in? Is the quality of the data good enough to work with?




## How to Access an API

For an example of how to access data from an API, we will explore [Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/), a resource produced by the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP), a partnership between the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Library of Congress (LC). Among other things, this resource offers OCR text data for newspaper pages from 1770 to 1963. The majority of the newspapers included in Chronicling America are in the public domain, but there is a disclaimer from the Library of Congress that newspapers in the resource that were published less than 95 years ago should be evaluated for renewed copyright. The API is public and no API key is required. We'll use Chronicling America's API to explore their data and pull in an OCR text file. 

For this lesson, we’ll pretend that we’re at the start of a project and we are interested in looking at how Wisconsin area newspapers described World War I. We aren’t yet sure if we want to focus on any particular newspaper or what methods we want to use. We might want to see what topics were most prominent from year to year. We might want to do a sentiment analysis and see whether positive or negative scores fluctuate over time. The possibilities are endless! But first we want to see what our data looks like. 

By adding search/pages/results/? to our source’s URL https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ and adding some of the search parameters that we have already mentioned we can start building our query. We will want to look for newspapers in Wisconsin between 1914 and 1918 that mention our search term “war.” And to keep our corpus manageable, we want to see only the first pages using sequence=1. If we specify that we want to be able to see it in a JSON file, that will give us the following query: 

https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?state=Wisconsin&dateFilterType=yearRange&date1=1914&date2=1918&sort=date&andtext=war&sequence=1&format=json

Let’s take a look at what happens when we type that into our web browser. And let’s take a look at what happens when we remove the request to view it in a JSON format. 

Now let's explore making requests and getting data using python. 


```python
!pip install requests
!pip install pandas
```

```python
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/drive')
```

## Making a request

You can make an API call using a get() request. This will give you a response that you can check by accessing .status_code. There are different codes that you might receive with different meanings. If we send a request that can't be found, we get the familiar 404 code. A 200 response means that the request was successful. 


```python
#What happens when what you are looking for doesn't exist?
response = requests.get("https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/this-api-doesnt-exist")
print(response.status_code)
```

    404



```python
#Get json file of your search and check status
#First 20 search results
response20 = requests.get("https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?state=Wisconsin&dateFilterType=yearRange&date1=1914&date2=1918&sort=date&andtext=war&sequence=1&format=json")
print(response20.status_code)
```

    200


Now that we have successfully used an API to call in some of the data we were looking for, let's take a look at our file. We can see that there are 3,941 total items that meet our criteria and that this response has gotten 20 of them for us. We'll save our results to a text file. 


```python
# Look at json file
print(response20.json())
```

They\nipuckened their pace for an other half\nhour and still could discover no trace\nof the lost city. Peers thought some\none had run away with the pjace; Sas\nse thought there was some witchcraft\nabout the thing and Levereni’. proposed\nthey camp out and wait for a relief ex\npedition. A farmer passed by and the\nthree hailed him with. "Say, where’s\nManitowoc’?” The farmer thought\nthey were guying him and wanted to\nlight the crowd. Hasse thought it\nwould be a good plan to mount\nand holler as they used to do In olden\ntime w hen lost in the woods in hope\nthat someone in the city would hear\nand give an answering shout. Their\nqueer maneuvers made the farmers\nsuspicious and when one of the crowd\nwould approach a house to inquire\nabout Manitowoc, lie would he chased\nout of the yard with dogs. Peers went\ninto the woods having heard at one\ntime that persons lost could find ttieir\nway homo by noticing on which side of\nthe tree the moss grew. Put it was as\nhard to find moss as it was to lind the\ncity. In the meantime the farmers\nwere collecting with pitchforks, hoes\nand axes to drive away the three dan\ngerous looking characters who pre\ntended they did not know the way to\nManitowoc. The trio set olf on a run\nand took anew road. They reached\nthe Pranch village by nightfall but\ndidn’t know the place. One of them\ninsisted it was Amigo and that there\nwere a few people there who know\nhim. Another thought it was Hurley\nas they walked far enough to reach\nthat place. The third thought it was\nDepere and pointed to the river as\nproof. They came near having a row\nover the matter but in the nick of\nlime a man approached whom they\nknew. Py round about questions they\nlesrned where they were and hired a\nman to lake them home.\nNow when they go outside the city\nlimits for a walk one of ’em walks\nbackwards so as to keep the city from\ngetting awry from them. People who\nmeet them wonder why one fellow pre\nfers to walk backward, but the oilier\ni wo explain that he wras born that way.\nThey take turns in this task and never\nget beyond sight of the city.\nEDUCATIONAL.\n(ByC.

Most of these young people have\ncompleted the work of the elementary\nschools. The schools are located in\nthecountry and are intended primarl\'y\nfor country youth. The sciences con\nnected with agriculture are taught,\nbut the greatest emphasis is laid on\nhistory, biography, and literature.\nThe schools then are not vocational\nschools except in a very broad sense.\nThe great object is to awaken the\nintellectual life of the students, lo\nmake them ambitious to live efficient\nly and nobly, and to teach them how\nthis may be accomplished.\nIt is said that 10 per cent of the pop\nulation of Denmark goes through these\nschools. Their popularity is attested\nby the fact that they are supported by\ncooperative effort of the people them\nselves; only very small annual grants\nare received from the government.\n’[’he Folk High Schools are a mighty\nagency :n the life not only of the rural\ncommunities hut of the nation at large.\nFive members of the Denmark cabinet\narc from the Folk High Schools, four\nof these are farmers. Many members\nof the lower house of parliament are\nalso from these schools. Eighty per\ncent of the officials and managers in\nthe cooperative agricultural societies\nand enterprises have attended Folk\nHigh Schools.\nThe results achieved hy these schools\nare a good example of the remarkable\nresults which can lie achieved when\nthe people are given the kind of educa\ntion which they really need.\nDISEASES OF SCftOOLCHILDREN.\nTuhercu\'osis of the lungs is the lead\ning cause of deaths among American\nchildren during the period of school\nlife, Next in order ere incidents,\nO.TORRISON COMPANY\nTATE Extend to All Our\n* * Best Wishes for a\nProsperous and Happy New\nYear and Wish to Thank\nYou for the share of patron\nage with which you have\nfavored us ...\nWe are now in the midst of our\nannual inventory taking and\nbeginning with January 2nd you\nwill find throughout the entire\nstore unusual bargains priced so\nlow that if money-saving is the\nobject you should look through\nthe different departments . .\nO.

Early in th\'c\nday Matzi was arrested on a charge of\npetty larceny made by William Schnei\nder, a contractor, and after he had se\ncured an adjournment of this hearing\nuntil next Tuesday, Matzi himself be\ncame a plaintiff and isecured a civil\nwarrant for the arrest of William F.\nHoward and Essie O. Reading, two well\nknown contrac ors. He charged them\nwith tresspass alleging that the cor trac\ntors had entered a house on the west\nside after Matzi had taken possession\nof it under a contract to secure a land\ncontract. The land contract had not\nbeen drawn, but M.atzi alleged that he\nwas in possession of the premises.\nHoward and Reading declared that they\nhad entered the place as contractors to\nfinish up work which had been con\ntracted for before Matzi took posses\nsion They declared that they had the\n-perrtrtfsioh of Matzi and his wife to\nenter the premises.

R. B. Way, vice president\nand manager of the electrical depart\nment of the company has been busy\nworking out the proposition for several\nweeks and he will come to Kenosha on\nMonday ready to submit his figures.\nNo indication as to the amount to be\nasked for the lights has been allowed\nto creep out of the offices of the com\npany and the proposition will be a\ncomplete surprise to the members of\nthe council. The company has made a\nformal petition to the mayor asking\nthat the hours for lighting in Kenosha\nbe changed. The suggestion is that the\nlights be started eight minutes earlier\nin the eveniug and turned off eight min\nutes earlier in the morning. This will\nmake the schedule in Kenosha conform,\nwith tne\'s* 1 nodule now in use in other\ncities in the state. It is probable that\nthe council will give its sanction to the\nchange in the schedule.\nMARRIED AT FOND DU LAC.\nMiss Grace Morris Becomes Bride of\nTheodore Hettrick Today.\nA wedding of great interest to many\nKenosha people was celebrated at St.\nJoseph church at Fond du Lac this\nmorning w\'hen Miss Grace Morris,\ndaughter of Mr. and Mrs. C.

The machine room will be\none story, 85x120 feet, and adjoining it\nwill be four new dry kilns. These kilns\nwill be each 18x120 feet in size. The\ncompany installed its present kilns\nseven years ago but the system now in\nuse has become antiquated and the\nplans for the coming year provide for\nthe installation of the latest kilns of\nthe Morton company. These, when com\npleted, will give the. company a capac\nity of 40,000 feet of dry lumber daily.\nThe next building will be a new power\nplant and this plant will provide for a\nchange from steam to electric power.\nIt is the plan cf the company to change\nover the pqwer of the entire plant as\nrapidly as possible and electric units of\nthe most modern kind will be installed.\nAnother building is a glue room which\nwill be used for veneering. This build\ning will be two stories in height and\n60x220 feet. With this space the busi\nness of the company may be greatly\nenlarged. The last building in the new\nplans is a great storage warehouse two\nstories in height and 60x122 feet in\nsize.\n“We are planning to double the ca\npacity of the plant,” said L. T. Han\nnahs m discussing the plans of the\ncompany this morning. “We appre\nciate that this building work will take\nsome time but we expect to rush the\noperations as much as possible. Growth\nof the business along many lines has\nmade necessary these big additions to\nthe plant. We desire to take care of\nthe business in the best possible man\nner and in order to keep abreast of the\ngrowing business a very large increase\nin capacity has been demanded.”\nThe Hannahs company has been\ngrowing by leaps and bounds in the\npast few years and the plant is now\none of the largest of the kind in the\ncountry. Its growth lias been a matter\nof especial interest to the people of\nKenosha on account of the fact that it\nhas been the product of local brains and\nlocal capital. The company hopes to\ncomplete all of the new buildings\nplanned by the end of 1914. Of course\nthis large increase in the size of the\nplant will bring a corresponding in\ncrease in the number of men to be em\nployed by the company. The company\nhas in recent months purchased land as\nsites for the new buildings and no fur\nther land will be required to carry out\nthe plans.\nMARRIED AT WAUKEGAN.\nNels Nelson and Katherine Ryan Have\nTrouble Fighting Railway Conductors.\nThere was a Kenosha wedding at\nWaukegan on Tuesday afternoon when\nMiss Katherine Ryan and Nels Kelson,\nboth well known among the young peo\nple of Kenosha, were married at the\nparsonage of one of the Waukegan\nchurches. The wedding was not with\nout a feature as the bride and groom\nhad considerable trouble having their\nwishes carried out. They had planned\nto be married by a minister who had\nofficiated at a wedding of the bride’s\nsister a year ago, but when they reach\ned Waukegan they were besieged by\nconductors on the street ears who were\nseeking marriage business for one of\nthe Waukegan justices.

It has been a year of joy and\nsorrow in Kenosha and it has brought\nits blessings and its pains. The year\nhas not been a notable one along any\nlines and there have been few great\nevents to make it stand out prominent\nly in the history of the city. Regarded\nas a hoo-doo year from the start peo\nple have dreaded the coming of calami\nties, yet few years have found less as\ncidents in Kenosha. There have, of\ncourse, been shadows in many hearts,\nbut these have been counterbalanced\nby joys in the hearts of others. The\ndeath rate in Kenosha during the year\nhas been a normal one. The city has\nbeen free from any serious scourge of\ncontagious disease, this being in\nstrange contrast to the preceding year.\nThere has been an unusually large\namount of crime in the city during the\ntwelve months and the courts have been\ncorrespondingly busy.\nIn the affairs of the municipality the\nyear has been one of many accomplish\nments. There has been large extensions\nof the paving and sewer systems of the\ncity. Much has been done along lines\nof systematizing the affairs of the var\nious departments and commissions un\nder city rule. The old trunk sewer\nclaim bogey laid over to 1913 by the\nformer year has been dispose! of in a\nmanner favorable to the city and fair\nto the contractors. Ashland avenue has\nbeen opened. The city has had much\ntrouble during the year in seeking to\nsecure better service from public utili\nty corporations but with the closing\nof the year it appears that most of\nthese problems have been satisfactorily\nmet. The new north side trunk sewer\nhas been started and is nearing comple\ntion, plans are under way to secure\nfiltration for the city water. The big\ngest problem that is being left over to\nthe new year is the problem of ar\nranging the tracks of the North-\nWestern Railway Company aud the\nproblem of securing the entrance of the\ninterurban cars to the heart of the\ncity. This problem was solved early\nin .1913, but the solution was found to\nbe an incomplete one.\nFinancially, the year has been a bet\nter one for the city than the preceding\none and, while taxes are higher than in\n1912, this was made necessary by the\ngreat increase in the state taxes.\nThe Industrial Year,\nAmong the industries of Kenosha\n1913 was a freak year. Up to the first\nof November it\' gave promise of prov\ning a record breaking year so the man\nufacturers, but the last two months of\nthe year have brought a slump. This\nis declared to be only temporary and\nmanufacturers agree that the opening\nof the new year will see nearly all the\nworkmen of Kenosha back in their old\npositions. No new industries of any\ngreat size have been established in the\ncity but a number of small plants have\nbeen opened and these promise to grow\ninto much greater industries before the\nend of another year. Many of the lo\ncal plants have made large additions\nduring the year and the number of em\nployed men and women in the city lias\nbeen increased.\nSchools Broaden Out.\nOne of the notable developments of\nthe year just closing was the broaden\ning out of the w\'ork of the publie\nschool system. Kenosha has done much\ntoward extending practical education\nfor its working classes and the city is\ndeclared to be a model for other cities\nin the state. Coupled with these move\nments have been movements for larger\nand better schools and for the build\ning of the new high school. The play\nground movement has been one of the\nreal live questions in Kenosha during\nthe year and plans which have matured\npromise to offer an early solution for\nthis problem in Kenosha.\nActive work has been done during\nthe year toward the extension of the\npark system of the city. This is cer\ntain to bear fruit within another year.\nNotable among the year’s accomplish\nments in the city was the completion\nof the wall about the Kenosha ceme\ntery. This is regarded as one of the\nOldest Paper\nIn\nThe Northwest\nNUMBER 36\nmost beautiful and substantial pieces\nof work ever done in Wisconsin.\nKenosha has added quo new church\nduring the year, the St. Anthony\'s\nchurch having been opened only a few\nmonths ago.\nThe most notable events of the year,\narranged in chronological order, fol\nlow:\nJanuary.\n3.

Towers, A. 8., J. of the\nMichigan Bar.\nWho Owns the Air?\n“Free as air” is ard\nso long as man had not succeeded in\nmastering the air this was true\nenough. There was air sufficient\nfor f I of us and as none could nay\nigate it with any success, questions\nof the control of the air did not\narise.\nBut now we the aeroplane\nand the airship and we are ; n what\npromises to be the beginning of an\nage of aviation. So it is that the\nlaw is beginning to develop: to keep\npace with the development of aero\nnautics. As yet flying machines are\nfew in number, but it seems that\nwe may well look forward to a time\nin the not far distant future when\nthe passage of aeroplanes and air\nships above us will be no uncom\nmon spectacle. What right has the\naeronaut to pass above our proper\nty? What are his liabilities in case\nhe causes injuries to those below\nhim? These and many similar\nquestions are arising, and the law\nis preparing to answer them as\nthey arise.\nIf one passes over your land, on\nthe surface, without your permis\nsion, be has committed a tresspass\nand though he may have caused no\nappreciable damage to your prem\nises, you may recover small dama\nges in a court of law by way of vin\ndication of your rights. What are\nyour rights against the aeronaut\nwho passes through the air above\nyour property? It is a fundamental\nrule of English law that a person’s\nproperty extends indefinitely down\nward and indefinitely upward. This\nrule has existed since the beginn\nings of law, and qnder it one has\ncontrol of the area above his land.\nA strict observance of this rule\nwould lead to this result: An aero\nnaut who passes above your land is\na technical trespasser, and though\nhe drops nothing upon you or yours,\nthough he cause you no real injury,\nhe has violated your rights —he has\ntrespassed—and you may sue him\nand recover damages. Such would\nbe the logical result of the applica\ntion of the law as it has long exist\ned in English-speaking countries.\nBut it seems highly improbable\nthat the law will be allowed to re\nmain in this condition. Aviation\nhas come to stay and it would seem\nto be a necessity that aeronauts be\nallowed to pass freely over the\nproperty beneath, whether it be pri\nvately owned or a public highway.\nThis necessity seems certain to\ncause a change in the law, which is\nlikely to come in the form of legis\nlative enactments concerning flying\nmachines. The French have already\ntaken action, a law having been re\ncently enacted which extends to\naeronauts free right to navigate the\nair, passing where they will. The\nnation retains the general control\nof the air, however, so that it may\nprevent any but French airships\nfrom flying over French territory,\nand make such regulations as may\nbe necessary.\nAmong the American states Con\nnecticut has taken the lead in pas\nsing legislation of this character.\nA law entitled “An Act Concerning\nthe Registration, Numbering, and\nUse of Air Ships, and the Licensing\nof Operators Thereof” was passed\nby that state in 1911. Under this\nlaw airships are subject to rules\nsimilar to those generally applied\nto automobiles. The owner must\nfile certain information with the\nSec. of State, pay a fee, receive a\ncertificate entitling him to fly, and\na number. This number must be\ndisplayed on the airship in letters\nnot less than three feet in height.\nAirships may be operated only by\nlicensed aeronauts.\nThis law fixes the responsibility\nfor all resulting damages in the fol-\nWE WISH YOU ALL A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR.\nThe River Falls Journal\nlowing section:\n“Every aeronaut shall be respon\nsible f>r all damages suffered in\nthis state by any >- son from injuries\ncaused by any voyage in an airship\ndirected by such aeronaut; aud if\nhe be the agent or employee of an\nother in making such voyage his\nprincipal or employer shall be re\nsponsible for such damage.”\nThe states of Massachusetts and\nNew York are considering similar\nlegislation and before many years\nit seems probable that every state\nwill have acted on this subject.\nThe question of fixing the respon\nsibility for damages, which b«s\nb ;en cared for in the Connecticut\nact, is one that is likely to be of\nimmediate importance. The dan\ngers of airships passing over prop\nerty are considerable. Parts, bag\ngage, or ballast might be dropped,\ncausing injury to persons or pro\nperty beneath. The fall of an aero\nplane upon a city might occasion\nsevere damage to those on land, as\nwell as to the unfortunate aeronaut\nBut fancy the damage resulting\nfrom the collision between two\ngiant airships of the Zepplin type\nWith the present interest in avia\ntion and the popular encourage\nment which it is receiving, the atti\ntude of the lawmakers is likely to\nbe favorable to them as far as\ngranting to them the right to freely\nuse the air is concerned Landown\ners are not likely to endeavor to de\nmand a fee from aeronauts passing\nover their property. The legisla\ntors are likely to grant great free\ndom of passage and the courts are\nlikely to sustain the legislation. Of\ncourse, a property owner might ob\nject that when the legislature grants\nthe right to navigate the air freely\nit gives a right to pass over his\nland and thus takes away from him\na portion of his property. Such a\ncontention, if made, will raise some\ninteresting cases, the result of\nwhich no one can foresee.\nBut as to fixing the responsibility\nfor injury resulting from the opera\ntion of airships, the law seems in\ndined to hold the aeronaut to strict\naccount. If the aeronaut wishes to\ntake the risk of riding in the air, he\nmust further take all the risk of\ncausing injury to persons or prop\nerty over which he passes. As mat\nters stand now, even in the absence\nof a statute fixing the responsibili\nties, as in Connecticut, a person in\njured by an airship may almost cer\ntainly recover damages from the\naeronaut. If a passing airship lets\ntall any object which injures your\nproperty you may sue the person\nwho is responsible for the operation\nof the airship.\nA few cases have already arisen\nin England. A British aeronaut\nwas driving his aeroplane and at\ntempted to descend into a field. The\nfield was occupied by a cow and the\ncow apparently resented the appear\nance of this strange object from\nabove. As the aeroplane descended\nthe cow rushed toward it, making\nhostile demonstrations. The aero\nnaut endeavored to avoid the infur\niated bovine, but was unsuccessfull\nand her cowship succeeded in plung\ning beneath the machine just as it\nreached the earth. The resu.ts\nwere disasterous to the cow, and\nthe sequel came when the farmer\nwho owned the cow sued the aero\nnaut and recovered damages for\nthe loss of the cow.\nThe aeroplane has found its way\ninto the classified ad columns as\nwell as into the courts, as witness\nhe following interesting ad which\nappeared in a German newspaper:\n“Lost from an aeroplane, a gold\nwatch and chain. Last seen disap\npearing in large stack of rye on a\nfield near Ulzen.”\n(Copyright, 1913, by Walter K.

WIS., JANUARY 2. 1914-\nMeal Inspection\nThe United Stales government pro\nvides for inspection of all meat picking\nplants which are engaged in interstate\nand foreign commerce. The, methods\nemployed in large plants are exceedingly\ninteresting. First, an inspection is made\nof all live animals and "suspects” arc\nculled for especially careful observation\nand regulated handling. After slaugh\nter, each nrocess in the further prepara\ntion of the carcass for the market, is\ncarefully watched The inspectors be\ncome highly skilled in the detection of\nevidences of diseased tissue which passes\nunder their eyes and hands.\nAs in the case of the first live Inspec\ntion upon the first suspicion of disease,\nan indelible brand sir-pends further prep\naration of the meat. The carcass is then\nshipped to a special examining room for\nfurther study and final disposition. By\nthis means, to reach the consumer the\nbody of a diseased animal would have to\npass the marvelously keen observation of\na number of highly skilled inspectors.\nThe diseases most often found are\ntuberculosis and actinomycosis in cattle;\ntuberculosis, hog cholera and various\nblood and organic diseases in swine.\nSome states have provided for inspec\ntion of abattoirs not under federal juris\ndiction. Wisconsin has made no such\nprovision. Dealers are sometimes sus\npected of offering for sale to inspected\npacking houses, only those animals which\nare presumably healthy. If this be so,\nmeat from uninspected slaughter houses\nis apt to be considerably below the nor\nmal average as concerns freedom from\ndisease.\nIn addition to the detection of diseased\nmeat, the inspectors maintain a close\nsnr yell lance over the general cleanliness\nof the plant. If the packers ever resent\ned the rigid demands of the government,\nno such resentment is now manifest.\nUndoubtedly, they recognize the govern\nment stamp of approval to he of distinct\ncommercial value.\nWonderful Cough Remedy\nDr. King’s New Discovery is known\neverywhere as the remedy which will\nsuwily stop a cough or*culd.

NUMBER 21\nPREVENTION FOR\nWHITE PLAGUE\nMedical Authority Tolls How To\nPrevent and Advises Patients\nShowing Symptoms\n“Tuberculosis has many characteristics\niji common with those of noxious weeds."\nI pon this theory the Wisconsin Anti-\nTuberculosis association has formulated\nits programme, according to Dr. 11. K.\nDoarholt of Milwaukee, director of the\nhealth bureau of the University of Wis\nconsin Extension division, and secretary\nof the organization.\n‘‘The must certain means of prevent\ning the spread of a weed pest is to gather\ncarefully and burn the seed," continued\nDoctor Dowrholt. Likewise, the most\ncertain way of preventing the spread of\nconsumption is to burn the seed.\n“Germs of consuption are contained in\nthe expectorations of patients suffering\nfrom the disease. Therefore if all ex\npectorations were carefully gathered\nin special cups, napkins and papers\nand burned before any of the seed\nwore scattered, tuberculosis would\nbecome historical. Karly knowledge at\nthe stage when the disease is most easily\ncured requires skillful diagnosis and\npatients should consult a skillful physi\ncian on first suspicion of infection, in\ndividuals who have been subjected to\nprolonged contact should have periodic\nexaminations extending over a number\nof years.\n“Providing sanitarium cure for ad\nvanced consumptives in a great measure\ncuts off the sources of infection. But a\nsufllcient number of sanatorium beds\nCan not be secured In a month or a year.\nAnd some patients may never consent to\ngo to a sanatorium. lienee we must pro\nvide as good protection as is possible\nfrom consumptives in the home. We can\naccomplish this by the visiting nurse\nand a wider knowledge of the funda\nmental facts in connection with the\nnature, cure, and prevention of the\ndisease."\nHog Cholera Don’ts\nThe following precautions are recom\nmended for keeping hog cholera from\nan uninfected drove by H T. Galloway,\nAsst. Sec. of Agriculture.\n1. Do not locate hog lots near a pul lie\nhighway, a railroad or n stream. The\ngerm of hog cholera may bo carried along\nany one of these avenues.\n2. Do not allow strangers or neighbors\nto enter your hog lots, and do not go in\nto your neighbors’ lots. If Is is absolute\nly necessary to pass from one hog lot in\nto another, lirst clean your shoes care\nfully and then wash them with a 21 per\ncent solution of the compound solution\nof crosol (U. S. P.)\n3. Do not put now slock, either hogs\nor cuttle, in lots with a herd already on\nthe farm. Newly purchased hogs should\nbe put in separate enclosures well sepa\nrated from the herd on the farm and\nkept under observation for three weeks,\nbecause practically all stock cars, un\nloading chutes, and pens are infected\nwith hog cholera, and hogs shipped by\nrail are therefore apt to contract hog\ncholera.\n4. Hogs sent to fairs should be quar\nantined for at least three weeks after\nthey return to the farm.\n5. If hog cholera breaks out on a\nfarm, separate the sick from the appar\nently healthy animals, and burn all car\ncasses of death. Do not leave* them mi\nburned, or this will endanger all other\nfarmers in the neighborhood.\n<5. If after the observance of all possi\nble precautions hog cholera appears on\nyour farm, notify the State veterinarian,\nor State Agricultural college, and secure\nserum for the treatment of those not\naffected. The early application of tills\nserum Is essential.\nSome of these precautions may seem\nunnecessary and troublesome, but they\ndo not cost much, and they are very\nvaluable preventive measures.\nThe Tax Kate\nThe tax rate in this city for the cur\nrent year is $16,00 per $1,0)0 in the Jef\nferson county wards and $18.13 in the\nDodge county wards* If the assesnirnt\nIs 90 per cent of the actual value, the\nrate is excessive: if the asnessed valua\ntion is moderate then the rate Is reason\nable —on the whole however Watertown\nhas no cause for complaint, below we\ngive the tax rate per 11,000 in some of\nthe other cities of the state:\nAn tigo $29.00, Bar a boo $23, 01, Beaver\nDarn s23.2o, Hoscobel S2B 00, Beloit $17.4b,\nBurlington $24,07, Edgerton 118.94, Kan\nClaire $23.50, Jefferson SIB.BO, Madison\n$16.50, Monroe $17.00, Oshkosh sl7 50,\nPltttteville 117.23, Portage $20.00, Janes\nville $15.00, Milwaukee 118.00, La Crosse\n$25,00, Richland Center $29.40, Toinah\n$20.12, Btonghton $18.70, Whitewater\n$25.90, W aterloo $17.94, Waukesha $19.50,\nLake Geneva $23.81,\nAn Ideal Woman’s Laxative\nWho wants to take salts, or castor oil,\nwhen there is nothing better than Dr.\nKing’s New Life Pills for all bowel\ntroubles.

Staaten im Jahre\n1913. trotz der Dürre und anderer hin\ndernden Umstände. Nach dem am\nMontag vom Ackerbaudcpartement in\nWashington veröffentlichten Bericht mar\ndas Jahr das erfolgreichste in der Ge\nschichte des Landes. Genau betragt der\nWerth der Ernte 6,100.000,000, wo\nvon K 3,650,000,000 aus Vieh entfallen.\nDer Werth ist doppelt so groß wie der\njenige der Ernte vom Jahre 1800; um\nmehr als eine Milliarde größer als im\nJahre 1009 und bedeutend größer als\nin 1912. Von der Gesanimlernle wird\nschätzungsweise 52 und von dem Vieh\n20 Prozent aus den Farmen selbst ver\nbleiben, sodaß das Bareinkommen der\nFarmer 55.847,000,000 beträgt.\nTrotzdem das Jahr 1913 ein Regen,\njähr war. und trotzdem die Zahl der\'\nFarmen sich seit 1910 um 11 Prozent\naus etwa 6,600,000 erbotn hat, ist nach\nAnsicht des AckerbaudevarlemenlS nicht\nzu erwarten, daß der Preis der Lebens\nmittel heruntergeht.

Sonne\nund Planeten erscheinen nämlich, we\ngen ihrer größeren Entfernung, als\nKreise oder Ellipsen, und so ist ihre\ngenaue Ortsbestimmung nicht beson\nders schwierig; der Mond dagegen\nerscheint nicht kreis- oder ellipsen\nförmig begrenzt, und daher ließ sich\nbisher sein Mittelpunkt oder Schwer\nPunkt nickt genau genug bestimmen.\nMan sucht: bisher diesem Uebelstande\ndurch E\'i\'füvrung eines „Fixpunttes"\nabzuhelfen, dessen selenographEche\nKoordinaten bestimmt wurden.

Und so ist es denn\nauch wohl als ein Akt ausgleichen\nder Gerechtigkeit aufzufassen, daß die\nLebewesen, die, statt sich wie die an\ndern auf ehrliche Weise durchs Le\nben zu schlagen, die bequemeren Da\nseinsbedingungen des Schmarotzer\ntums auszunutzen gelernt haben und\nvon den mühsam erworbenen Körper\nsästen anderer Wesen sich mäste,\nauch ihrerseits wieder, wenn auch\nwiderwillig, als Wirte aufzutreten\ngezwungen werden.\nDie Naturgeschichte kennt eine\nganze Reihe solcher Schmarotzer in\nSchmarotzern: zu ihnen gehört nach\nden Forschungen des Franzosen rw\nweran auch der Floh, der lustige\nSpringer, dem bekanntlich die größ\nte Kälte nichts anhaben kann. Der\nFamilie der Flöhe ist überhaupt in\nden letzten Jahren von der Forschung\nein außerordentliches Interesse ent\ngegengebracht worden, da man ver\nschiedene ihrer Angelürigen in dem\nbegründeten Verdacht hatte, daß sie\nbei der Uelertragung vcn allerlei an\nsteckenden Krankheiten ein? nicht ein\nwandfreie Nolle spielten. Auch der\nParasit, den Laweran im Hundefloh\nauffand, kann auf andere Tiere über\ntragen werden. Er stellt ein mi\nkroskopisch kleines Schräubchen vor,\ndas sich vom Darminhalt nährt, sich\nin ihni bewegt und entwickelt. Bringt\nman mit Hilfe einer Manipulation,\nzu der allerdings e\'was geschickte\nFinger gehören, den Darminhatt de-\nFlohs in eine schwache Kochsalzlö\nsung und spritzt diese weißen Mäu\nsen ein. so findet man die Spirillen\nbald in den Blutkörperchen der\nMäuse, wo sie wahrscheinlich ihre\nweitere Entwicklung durchmachen.\nDie Erscheinung, daß Schmarotzer\nwieder vcn anderen Schmarotzern\nheimgesucht werden, findet sich auch\nsonst. So werden gewisse Schlupf\nwespenlarven, die in Schmclterlings\nraupen leben, wieder von kleineren\nSchlupfwespen angestochen, obgleich\nsie dort allem Anschein nach vor\ntrefflich geschützt sind. Ja. es komm!\nder besondere Fall vor, daß das\nMännchen einer parasitisch lebenden\nTierart als Schmarotzer seines eben\nfalls an die parasitische Lebensweise\nangepaßten Weibchens auftritt. Die\nser immerhin seltene Fall von T-p\n-pelparasitismus findet sich bei ge\nwissen Rankenfußk\'-etssen. zu denen\nauch die Entenmuscheln gehören: das\nMänncken sucht schon als vollstän\ndig ausgerüstete Larve das Weibchen\nauf, verliert hier seine Beweglichkeit\nund seine Gliedmaßen vollkommen\nund lebt als Zwergmännchen weich\neingebettet in der Schal? des Weib\nchens und nährt sich, indem es die\nSäfte des Weibchens einfach mit\nder Körperbau! aussäugt: denn ihm\nfehlt später auch der Mund und\nder Darm vollständig.\nEin noch krasserer Fall von Pa\nrasitismus. bei dem allerdings da?\nWeibchen frei lebt, findet sich bei den\nzu den Sternwürmcrn gehörigen Bo>\nnellia des Mitlelmeeres; hier leben\ndie Männcken sogar im Fruchthalter\ndes Weibchens, zwischen den von\ndiesen beroorgebrachtrn Eiern, die\nvon ibnen befruchtet werden.

So gaben zu\nAnfang des Krieges verschiedene der\nägäischen Inseln besondere Briefmar\nker, heraus, z. B. Jkanen, Mytilenr,\nSamos und Lemnos. Griechenland\nversah die in den eroberten Gebieten\nverwendeten Marken mit einem be\nsonderen Ueberdruck, und neuerdings\nhat auch der werdende Staat Alba\nnien sich schon mit der Herausgabe\nvon eigenen Briefmarken befaßt. Zu\nerst verwendete man dort türkisch\nMarken, die mit einem höchst primi\ntiven albanischen Adler überdruckt\n\'Wurden. In der letzten Zeit aber hat\nman\'einen regelw-chten Stempel ange\nfertigt, welcher die Inschrift trägt\n„Postat c Qeverrics se Perlohefhme":\ndiese Marke wurde in den Werten zu\n2E Para und l Piaster herausgege\nben, d. h. die Postbeamten stellen sie\nselbst her. indem sie diesen Stempel\nauf ein Stück Papier drucken und auf\nden ihnen übergebenen Brief Neben.\nGriechenland hat den Briefmarken\nsammlern im legten Stadium noch\neine ganze Reihe bon provisorischen\nMarken beschert, die zu den seltensten\ngehören, welche seit Ansang dieses\nJahrhundcris überhaupt ausgegeben\nwurden. So hatten die Bulgaren in\nder für einige Zeit besetzten Hafen\nstadt Kawalla iyr eigenen Marlen\neingeführt. AIS die Griechen diesen\nOrt einnahmen, fanden sie einen klei\nne Nest dieser Marken vor und ver\nsahen sie schnell mit einem griechischen\nAusdruck. Von einzelnen dieser Pi"\nvisoricn sind nur 10 Stück hergestellt,\nwodurch sich ihre Seltenheit erklärt.\nAls die griechische Floite vor Dedca\ngatsch lag, wurden auf ihren Schiffen\nBriefe zur Weiterbeförderung ange\nnommen. In Ermangelung von\nMarken fertigte man amtlich recht\neckige Papierstücke an, die mit einer\ngriechischen Inschrift und der Wert\nangabe bedruckt wurden. Als diese\nVorräte zu Ende gingen, nahm man,\nwie in Kawalla. bulgarische Marken\nund bedruckte sie ähnlich wie dort.\nSehr selten sind auch die in G\nmüldschina ausgegebenen Provisorien\nzu 10 und 25 Lepta. Diese Stadt\nwar ursprünglich von den Bulgaren\nerobert, wurde aber dann von den\nGriechen besetzt. Im Autarkster\nFrieden sie! sic wieder an Bulgarien,\ndoch tonnte dieses sie nicht sofort be\nsitzen, sodaß die griechische Besatzung\nlänger dorr bleiben mußte. Während\ndieser Zeit hat man nun türiische\nBricsmar\'en, die inan vorfand, mit\neinem mehrzelligen Ueberdruck in\ngriechischer Sprache versehen und\nauch noch das griechische Wappen hin\nzugefügt. To auch viese Marken nur\nin geringer Zabl hergestellt wurden,\nist ihre Selienheit sehr erklärlich.\nSchließlich sah sich auch Bulgarien\nzur Herausgabe einer Serie von l\nl. is 27 Stoiinli mit einem aus den\nAnlaß zu ihrer Herausgabe bezug\nnibmenden Ueberdruck versehen: sie\nwürd, in größerer Anzahl au-geae \'\nlen.

My Income was light and my ex\npense* in proportion. Millinery bill for the\nseaaun was a ton cent straw hat with a live\ncent ribbon for our daughter Dora, which was\nall satisfactory.

John B. Densmore\nof the department of labor so an\nnounced after a final effort to bring\nthe warring interests together.\nHe did not hesitate to Marne his\nfailure upon the uncompromising at\ntitude of the mine owners, who re\nfused to recognize the Western Fed\neration of Miners as a party to arbi\ntration proceedings or other peace\nprojects.\nDensmore Tells Story.\n“In a nutshell, the question was\nwhether the union men should go back\nto work with or without discrimina\ntion. The companies refused to do\nanything but discriminate against\nmembers of the union,” said Mr. Dens\nmore.\n“It means a struggle to the bitter\nend,” said O. N. Hilton, chief of coun\nsel of the Western Federation of\nMiners, who has represented Presi\ndent C. H. Moyer here since the lat\nter’s deportation. “The outcome is\ndue entirely to the attitude of the\ncompanies. They wanted everything\nand would concede nothing.”\nCompromise Is Rejected.\nThe union’s last word was an offer\nto withdraw the Western federation\nTom the field, its place to be taken by\n. union affiliated with the Michigan\nFederation of Labor, the United Mine\nWorkeis, with which the Western Fed\neration of Miners is affiliated, or some\nsimilar body. This was rejected ab\nsolutely by the companies.\nThe employing interest suggested to\nMr. Densmore that a secret vote of the\nmen on strike, if properly safeguard\ned, would show a majority of them in\nfavor of returning to work outside the\nunion fold. When this was broached\nto the federation men there was an\nimmediate declination to submit the\ncase to any such test. Word of the\nnegotiations was telegraphed to the\nsecretary of labor by Mr. Densmore.\nHe said that a full report of the ef\nforts made would be made by him aft\ner his return to Washington.\nThe strike has been in progress\nsince July 23. Now that Mr. Dens\nmore has given up and is going back\nto Washington, there are prophecies\nthat it will last much longer. J. E.\nRoach, a representative of Samuel\nGompers, president of the American\nFederation of Labor, said:\n“This strike will not be settled for\neight months. It will run longer than\nthat. It will go a year. The American\nfederation will aid the strikers, and\nother organizatinos will help.”\nAttack on Moyer Up to Grand Jury.\nThe Houghton county grand jury\nwas specifically charged by Judge H.\nH. O’Brien of the circuit court to in\nvestigate the kidnaping of Moyer.\nMoyer was forcibly deported, beaten\nand shot.\n“If the jury believes there is reason\nable amount of evidence pointing to\nward persons connected with the kid\nnaping, they are* to be investigated\nand indicted,” Judge O’Brien charged.\nThe grand jury is made up of James\nMacNaughton’s chauffeur, Edgar Bye,\nseveral mine superintendents and two\nSocialists. The evidence is being\nplaced before the grand jury by\nGeorge Nichols, a special prosecutor\nappointed by Governor Ferris to con\nduct the investigation.\nJudge O ltrien has been condemned\nby the mine mauagers and the mem\nbers of the Citizens’ alliance without\nmercy. Placards charging that he\ntried to mediate the strike in the\ncause of the Western Federation of\nMiners have been posted on the bill\nboards in Calumet township, and in\nthe Calumet & Hecla stamp mills one\nof the largest posters is displayed.\nFerris on Way to Calumet.\nCalumet, Mich., Jan. s.—Governor\nFeriis, Labor Commissioner Cunning\nham and Secretary Nesbit will arrive\nin the copper country tonight. The\ngovernor will prosecute a vigorous in\nvestigation of the strike in the hopes\nof bringing about a settlement.

Very much of this criticism\nis bad because it is unsound, untrue,\nand while objecting to tbe existing,\nhas nothing better to substitute. All\nof it is uDfortudate because it lowers\nthe value of a school education in the\nminds of unthinking people who need\nthe school the most. It is not at all\nunusual to find articles in any paper\nor magazine today bearing the title cf\nthis paragraph. Tbe following dis\ncussion which answers tbe question\nnegatively, written hy ,T. W. Red\nvay, is an extract from the Western\nTeacher” for December.\n‘‘l take New York City as an\nexample. Knocking New York schools\nis quite tbe customary habit, and the\nsmall army of efficiency experts can\nfind nothing good about them.\nThree quarters of a million pupils\nattend them and about twenty\nthousand teachers constitute the\nteaching staff. Not far from one\nthird of tbe enrollment cousists of\npupils of foreign birth or are tbe\nchildren of foreign born parents.\nAt the present time the parents are\nmainly Italians, Russian Jews,\nSyrians, Poles, and Greeks They\nare the unskilled laborers and tbe\nvital energy of the sweat shops. So\nfar as tbe parents are concerned the\nproblem is simple. They will live a\nwhile, herded as sheep are herded,\nthen they die, But their children\nare the greatest problem on earth\ntoday. Let us see the work of the\nNew Y 7 ork schools un them, by a\nstudy of the past.\nFifty years ago the Irish formed\nthe chief factor in the unskilled\nlabor population. Walk along any\nbusiness street and one might be sure\nof seeing signs reading— ‘Man wanted ;\nno Irish need apply. ’ Well, the\nadult generation lived and died; that\nwas all. Their children went to the\npublic scbcol. but they were never\nin any great proportion unskilled\nlaborers. The third generation of\nthese Irish immigrants is still living\nin New York City. Who are they,\nand what are they ’ The answer is\neasy : they are the greatest factor in\nthe political and industrial energy of\nthe state—senators, congressman,\nengineers, contracture, clergymen,\neducators and railroad builders. And\nthe Jews of three generations ago?\nbankers, merchants, and capitalists.\nBoth nationalities are furnishmg tbe\nred blood of tbe country today.\nPardon another heresy ; the red blood\nis worth a lot more to the country\nthan the blue blood.\nNow it has been shown that if the\nhuman mind goes without training\nbetween the ages of six and twenty it\nceases to grow. Suppose that all these\nyouugsters of foreigD born parentage\nbad grown up without school train\ning. The answer to this is also easy ;\nthey would have been just what\ntheir grand parents were—the flotsam\nand jetsam of civilization.\nIn the city of Mount Vernon. New\nYork, it costs about six hundred dol\nlars to steer a youngster through the\nelementary aud high schools The\naverage income of one hundred men\ngraduates of the high schol is not far\nfrom fifteen hundred dollars a year.\nAt five percent this is the income on\nthirty thousand dollars. Ia other\nwords, we invest six hundred dollars\nand tbe product commands just fifty\ntimes that sum What a failure!”\nTHE WINTER SHORT COURSE\nMention was made in this column a\nshort time ago of the winter short\ncourses which were being introduced\nin a number of Wisconsin high\nschools this year. From the reports\nia the educational papers, the idea is\nnot wholly confined to this state.\nThe Geneseo, Illinois, Township High\nSchool has begun such a course for\ncountry boys. The course started\nDecember first with an enrollment of\ntwenty-four boys, ranging in age\nfrom fifteen to twenty years, and in\nadvancement, from the eighth grade\nto the third year of the high school.\nThe establishment of the course\nthere is the result of a definite de\nmand on the part of the farmer tax\npayers who have not been receiving\nthe benefits they tbiuk tbey ought to\nhave from the money they are pay\ning, because they need their boys for\nfall and spriug work on the farms.\nInquiries made by Principal Beatty\ndeveloped the fact that there were\nenough of the country boys interest\ned in the proposed coarse to warrant\nthe undertaking, hut it was not ex\npected that the enrollment for the\nfirst year would be more than twelve\nor fifteen.\nFive classes have been organized\nand each student is enrolled for four\nof the five; all but one are in the\nagriculture class.

Tbe dear body was\nbrought to Lancaster that it might\nrepose beside ber children. The bus\nband was broken hearted and would\nnot be comforted. He had been\ncrippled by disease and for many of\ntbe daily comforts of life was de\npendent upon the loving, faithful\nministries of his wife. None could\ntake her place. For some months be\nremained with his brother aDd sister,\nMr. and Mrs. Philip Beunett where\nhe received all the kindly attention\nthey could bestow. Then the son\nPhil came back to the tld borne in\nthis city where he and his wife tried\nto make tbe father comfortable aud\nhappy But he mourned incessantly,\nand prayed to be delivered of this life\nthat be might be reunited with his\nloved ‘‘Eliza ” Existence tc bim\nwas only a burden without her com\npanionship Had he been strong and\nable bodied, he probably would have\ntaken up bis cross and borne it brave\nly as others do under irreparable\nlosses. In his decrepit state is it any\nwonder be so mourned so loyal a help\nmeet as Bennett was. The lov\ning Father noted his sorrow, and\nheeded tbe cry of bis heart. On the\nmorning of December 19, 1913, while\nsitting in bis chair with not a long\nwarning of his near approach, tbe\ndeath angel touched bim gently and\nhe passed peacefully away. Tbe sons\nGeorge us Mather and Phil of Lancas\nter, with their families other rela\ntives, and friends sorrow for their\nloss—and yet rejoice that the parents\nwere not long divided. Rev. Beavins,\npastor of tbe M. E. church where last\nservices were tendered, spoke beauti\nfully of tbe re-union —tbe joy of the\nfirst Christmai together in a land\nwhere pain of parting never comes.\nThe floral offerings were many.\nFor these and tbe many other kindly\nand consoling offices of friendship tbe\nsurviving relatives are very grateful.\n“Some fair tomorrow we shall know\nLife’s mysteries that hurt us so:\nThe love and wisdom in disguise\nWill then be open to our eyes.”\nb. d. a.\nRaincoats at Ten cents.\nA man in Illinois has invented a\nprocess to produce and market a rain\ncoat that can be retailed from 10\ncents up. These coats are made in\nthe regulation slip on style, from an\nintegral part of waterproof paper.\nTheir production cost will be no\nhigbtr than 5 cents each, and even\nthat figure can be lessened. The coat\ncan be folded np to fit in any ordinary\neuvelope and is particulary adapted\nto bring carried in bandoags\nThe coats can be made of oiled\npaper or paraffin, vellum parchment\npaper, which gives the appearance of\nsilkiness at a short distance. Tbe\noriginal idea was for the coats to be\nworn only once, but after a trial, it\nwas demonstrated tbat they could be\nutilized successfully two or three\ntimes. The coats are re-inforced\nwhere the buttons are sewed on and\nalso where the button holes are cut.\nThere are only two seams, both\nrunning underneath tbe arms and\ndown the sides. These seams are\ncemented by ordinary glue.—New\nYork Times.\nMethodist Church.\nThos. S.

Found In Home of\nFriend by Officers.\nThe attempt of Elizabeth Hensehel,\nfifteen years old, to commit suicide,\ncaused a great deal of excitement in\nthe fourth ward Saturday evening.\nMiss Hensehel left home about six\no’clock Saturday evening, because\nshe fea-ed her father. She had stated\nfollowing a beating he had given her\non a previous occasion, that if he\never beat her again she would kill\nherself. She went to the river and\nattempted to get into deep water,\nbut was unsuccessful and finally gave\nit up and wandered to the house of\na friend where she was taken care\nof and afterward found by the offi\ncers.\nAccording to the story told by the\ngirl and the officers, she intended\nto drown herself, hut because of the\nshallow water and ice she did not\nsucceed. It is said that several\nweeks ago her father gave her a\nsevere beating and she made the\nstatement that she would kill her\nself if he ever beat her again. Sat\nurday evening Hensehel learned that\nshe had been to a moving picture\nshow and began to raise a row. The\ngirl fled from the house. Officer\nBanter and Undersheriff Bluett were\nsent for and took up the hunt for the\nmissing girl. She was traced to the\nriver and the place where she| start\ned out on the ice was discovered\nSearch along the hank showed where\nshe had come back to shore. The of\nficers agreed that she had probably\nbeen unable to get to deep water\nand had returned to shore and was\nin the home of some friend. A sys\ntematic search of all the houses in\nthe neighborhood was commenced.\nThe officers were not saitsfied with\nthe verbal denial of the people but\ninsisted upon searching the houses.\nThe girl was finally found at the\nhome of Emil Toeple on Burt street.\nMr. and Mrs. Toeple took the girl\nin and had put her to bed under\nwarm blankets. It was after eleven\no’clock before the sdhrch was over.\nThe father finally arrived and got\nclothing for the girl and took her\nback to her home.\nDISCUSS WORK\nOF CIRCUIT COURT\nSay Double Trial System Should\nBe Abolished.\nThe circuit judges of the state\nhave been in session at Madison,\nwith the committee of lawyers ap\npointed at the last session of the\nlegislature to investigate court sys\ntems.\nThat the double trial system in\nprobate matter® is a drag on the\ncourts and should be abolished, was\none of the decisions reached. Judge\nA. H. Reid of Wausau and others\ndeclared there should be either an\nappeal from county court to .supreme\ncourt or else, when an issue is. join\ned in probate court, that the matter\nbe certified to circuit court for\ntrial.\nThere w r as considerable discussion\nover the proposed abolition of the\noffice of justice of the peace, but\nno decision was reached.\nThis was the first meeting of the\nlegislative committee since appoint\nment. It will report to the next leg\nislature the result of the investiga\ntion and submit a plan that appears\nto best suit the state needs and\nmeet with the approval of the state\njudiciary.\nMonday evening the circuit judges\nwere entertained at a banquet at\nwhich Judge W. J. Turner of Milwau\nkee, spoke of the divorce evil. He\nsaid that probably 5d per cent of the\ndivorces in Milwaukee county might\nhe avoided if anew system of grant\ning divorces was devised. Judge\nTurner believes that the legislature\nshould pass a law creating the posi\ntion of divorce lawyer to be appoint\ned by the circuit judge and no divorc\naction could be brought, except bj\nthis mam. “I think,’’ said Judge\nTurner, “that there are a large\nnumber of divorces brought b> law\nvers’ runners, who have brought out\nan evil as great as the ambulance\nchaser in personal injury cases. Then\ntoo. divorced women often urge wo\nmen who have had a quarrel to get\na lawyer and get a divorce. These\nremarks were made in refernece to\nMilwaukee county cases. Judge Turn\ner said he did not believe that the\nsame conditions prevailed in every\ncounty of the state.\nENDORSES SENATOR HATTON\nThe Eagle-Star is glad to note that\nWilliam H. Hatton of New London,\nis an announced candidate for the\nRepublican gubernatorial nomination.\nWe have contended for months that\nhe was the key to the situation for\nthe Republicans of Wisconsin. No\nother man, so far mentioned, com\nbines all the qualities necessary in\na candidate for the chief executive\nship, as he does. The Republicans of\nWisconsin have before them the big\ngest state fight of two decades. The\nstate situation, a Democratic presi\ndent in the chair, favor the opposi\ntion and it will need all the resources\nof a united Republican party to carry\nthe next state election. Mr. Hatton\nwill unite the parties as no other\nman can and is an ideal man for\nthe Then why not do\nthe logical thing. Republicans, and\nnominate him?—Marinette Eagle-Star\nMOTOR NUMBERS\nCO OUTOF STILE\nNew Number Plates of a Better\nDesign\nMOTORIST TO BE GIVEN TIME\nState is Unable to Provide Applicants\nWith License Numbers —Sorpe\nNew Numbers Here.\nRaus mat the 1913 automobile num\nbers. They went out of date at mid\nnight Wednesday, That was the last\nsecond that the 1913 licenses were\ngood. A few Grand Rapids automo\nbile owners already have their new\nnumbers. Those who have declare\nthat they are an improvement over\nthe 1913 numbers, because they are\nof better make-up and are more dis\ntinguishable.\nThe 1914 number plates are made\nfrom one piece of sheet steel, the\nnumber being pressed into relief in\nstead of tacked on as they wqre\nin 1913. The background of the num\nber plate is ena.maled white and the\nnumbers are enameled black, conse\nquently the Wisconsin number plate\nhave about all the contrast colors\nwill permit.\nThe new numbers are slightly\nwider than the §ld onesi, and the fact\nthat they are pressed from the steel\nplate instead of tacked on to it will\nmake it easier for motorists to keep\nt v -cl 0 ? -\'V fl .ip e&jbi q s-ha l^ ■\nNo one will be arrested: if he de\nports himself on country roads or\ncity streets with the 1913 number\nplate attached. The state department\nis so swamped with applications for\nnew numbers that it is impossible to\nissue new numbers fast enough. The\nfact that there are more automobiles\nin service this winter than ever be\nfore has only served to increase the\nrush of applicants.\nThe law, leisurely interpreted, give\nmotorists time enough to get their\nnumbers and run with the old ones\non until they do, because the state\nknows that before very much time\nelapses new numbers will be procur\ned. So apply for new numbers and\ndrive with the old ones until the\nstate sends you the new black and\nwhit© figures.\nTWO APPOINTED\nOK COUNTY JUDGE\nSoldier.s Relief Committee Now\nComplete Again.\nThe vacancies on the Soldiers’\nRelief Committee have been filled\nby County Judge - W.

Pagel was plac\ned under bonds of $l6O to keep the\npeace for six months. Officer Pan ter\nwent to Pagel’s home and demanded\nthe revolver. By the time the offi\ncer got through he had a collection\nof three of the most interesting\n“gats” that have come to light in\nthis community in years. One gun\nwas a short regular British Bull Dog\nrevolver, another was a double bar\nreled derringer of about 44 caliber\nand the last was a four barreled\nbrass muzzle loading outfit that must\nhave been handed down from the\nearly German wars. Two of the guns\nwere found loaded.

Business was\nentirely suspended in this town during\nFriday, Saturday and Monday—no oue\nbeing able to be out doors any length\nof time. The material in our office\nwas frozen together so that the hands\ncould not touch the type or work the\npress, which will account for the ab\nsence of any paper last week. We\nwere without mail an entire week.\nThe cold weather extended through\nout the country and we hear of many\ncases of suffering on the railroads and\nother thoroughfares.\nEffects of The Cold—We notice\nby our exchanges that throughout the\nwhole State the severity of the weath\ner was extremely felt, and in many\nplaces we hear of persons being badly\nfrozen—in a few instances resulting in\nloss of life. In this section we have\nheard of but few sufferers. One un\nfortunate fellow, residing in Brown\ncounty, had both his feet frozen so\nbadly that it was at first supposed he\ncould not live, but through the skill\nful efforts of Dr. Balcom, ho is in k\nfair way to recover, though amputation\nof one of the limbs was found to be\nnecessary.\nA Large Establishment — Mr.\nWilliam liabr, the well known Brewer\nhas just completed a very large estab\nlishment for the manufacture of lager\nbeer, and at his invitation many of our\ncitizens visited his cellar on Saturday\nlast.

Adjoining\nthe main room is a yeasting cellar 56\nx 20 feet, covered with solid masonry.\nMr. Ruhr\'s establishment is one of\nthe largest and finest in the state, and\nwe hope large expense incur\nred by him will be returned four-fold.\nU is enterprise and public spirit should\nbe followed by others.\nLincoln wants more men —We\nthought the Emancipation Procla\nmation was to put an end to me wdr!\nHow is that?\nTWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO.\nHon.

Vet\nthese are the very places most in need\nof it. In the larger centers competent\ndoctors are available, and in the cities\nfree medical and dental clinics may al\nways be found, but in the country med\nical and dental attention is often diffi\ncult to obtain.\nAgain, people in the country are\nlittle inclined to seek aid from physic\nians or dentists, simply because they\nhave not yet been educaflAi to do so\nexcept in serious cases. It therefore\nhappens that children of the rural\nschools are in general (contrary to the\ngeneral impression) more in need of\nmedical and dental attention than the\nchildren of larger communities.\nThere is also a common impression\nthat country children are naturally\nmore vigorous than city children.\nr i his ought to bo true, but unfortun\nately it is not. In general food is not\nas well prepared in the country as it\nis in the city; the available variety is\nsmaller; the houses and schools are\nless well ventilated, overheating in\nwinter is common; tuberculosis is not\nso well understood and the chances for\n“house infection” are therefore great\ner; and general public sanitation is\nalmost without exception neglected in\nthe country.\nChildren in the country are more ex\nposed to unfavorable weather condi\ntions than are city children. They of\nten walk long distances in extreme\nheat, cold, or wet; and sit in school\nwith damp clothing or wet feet. They\nalmost invariably wear 100 much cloth\ning indoors in cold weather, and are\nconsequently overheated in the school\nroom and then are chilled on the way\nhome. Under such conditions it is no\nwonder that colds and other respira\ntory disorders are common, and that\nmany country children are out of\nschool on account of various kinds of\nsickness\nTin sanitation of a rural school is\nusually very bad. The common drink\ning cup hangs from a nail over the\nwater pail; floors and desks are often\nvery dirty; ventilation is a negligible\nquantity; outdoor toilets are in un\nspeakable condition; washing facilities\nare either not provided at all, or con\nsist of a pail of water, a dirty tin basin,\nand one common towel.- From U, S.\nliureau of Kducation Letter.\nThe above letter needs to be heeded\nat this time of the year. There is\nmuch sickness throughout the county\nand city. Several schools were closed\nbefore the holidays. School boards\ncannot give the matter of fumigation\ntoo much attention at this time. The\nschool house ought to disinfected fre\nquently now. Some children catch\ndiseases from each other very readily.\nTake alt necessary precaution, it is\ncheaper than paying doctor bills, and\nmay prevent an epidemic in the com\nmunity.\nBl) v LAND ON EASY TEHMS.\nCut over hard wood lands in Wiscon\nsin, from 915.00 per acre up. 91 00 per\nacre cash, balance in monthly install\nments of 9. r j.oo on each forty (.ought.\nNo better proiswltion known.

The missing girl\'s father\nclosed his business in Marshfield and\ntraced hi3 daughter\'s progress from\nthe moment she left her home. The\npolice were notified, but until\nWednesday morniDg nothing was\nknown beyond that she had been seen\non the train at Merrillan. On Wed\nnesday morning Mr. Engelman re\nceived word from the marshall at Wild\nRose that a girl answering to Miss\nEagelman’s description had taken a\ntrain for Pine River.\nHer father left immediately for Pine\nRiver and found his daughter on the\npoint of leaving for parts unknown\nwith a young woman companion. Tae\nlatter, who has been employed at the\nEngelman home at Marshfield\nand who was twenty-two\nyears of age, unbeknownst to the other\nmembers of the family, had induced\nLillian to promise to leave her home\non some pretense or other and meet\nher at Pine River where the twain ex\npected to “run away”. This attempt\nwas frustrated by Mr. Eogelmsn who\narrived at the rendezvous in the nick\nof time and returned with a penitent\nand, it is hoped, wiser daughter.\nNeedless to say the young girl’s act\ncaused much anxiety to her uncle in\nBaraboo, who met every train since\nher arrival was expected and gone to\nother trouble as well. Her uncle in\nBaraboo states that as far as he knows\nLillian had no reason to leave a good\nhome. In his letter to his brother in\nBaraboo Mr. Engelman does not state\nthe seducer’s name to whom rightly\nbelongs a of the blame.\nSEMI INJURED\nBE HiSE’S HOOF\nAnimal, Uneasy in Black\nsmith Shop, Kicks By\nstander on Skull.\n(Prom Friday\'s Daily.)\nAs Lawrence Luce, son of Mr. and\nMrs. J.

Rooney of Chicago, who has\ninterested himself in the municipal\nChristmas tree plans has sent a letter\nto Mayor Head offering to donate to\nthe city of Kenosha a great pine tree\nto be planted somewhere in the city\nand to be used as a perpetual Christmas\ntree. Rooney furnished the municipal\ntree to Chicago this year. The proposi\ntion is that he will ship the tree to Ke‘-\nnosha with the soil frozen about the\nroots and he holds that if it is planted\nunder such conditions that the transfer\nof it from the northern forests to Ke\nnosha will in no way retard its growth.\nRooney plans to ship trees to seventy\ncities in Illinois, Indiana and Wiscon\nsin.\nMayor Head declared today that he\nwas favorable to the proposition and he\nsuggested that the tree be secured and\nset up in the Market Square Park at\nthe intersection of Church street\nSTARTS ON 810 TASK\nMayor Head Busy Investi\ngating Petitions Asking\nFor Commission Form.\nSMALL MARGIN TO WORK ON\nI\nMayor Declares That He Wil. 1 Rush the\nWork of Investigation and Is»,.t For\nmal Proclamation Just as Soon as Ha\nIs Satisfied With the Petitions.\nMayor Dan 0. Head has started the\narduous task of checking up the names\non the petitions demanding a referen\ndum on the commission form of govern\nment. At the last general election in\nthe city there were 4,010 votes cast for\nall the candidates for mayor and in or\nder to have the question of the com\nmission form submitted to the people\nthe petitions now in the hands of the\nmayor must contain the names of 1,010\nqualified electors of tne city of Keno\nsha. The petitions contain exactly\n1,027 names so that the margin is but\nseventeen and it is probably that this\nwill be reducted by the elimination of\nduplicate signatures. Mayor Head will\nprobably he abb to complete the ex\namination of the names on the petition\nwithin two weeks and if he is satisfied\nthat the number is sufficient he will\nlose no time in issuing his proclama\ntion. Under the law the election must\nbe held within sixty days after the\npresentation of the petition and the\nproclamation of the mayor must be is\nsued within thirty days in order to\ngive time for the preliminaries to the\nprimary.\nThe law provides that should the com\nmission form be adopted by the refer\nendum vote that the candidates for\nmayor and for councilmen must be\nnominated at a regular primary elec\ntion. This primary is to be held under\nthe law which has governed city pri\nmaries in the past. The candidates\nmust silo affidavits of their candidacy\nat least twenty days before the date\nset for the primary and the affidavits\nmust be accompanied by a petition\nsigned by at least twenty-five electors.\nAll petitions must be circulated at\nlarge and under the commission form\nward lines will be entirely w : ped out.\nSome of the opponents to the com\nmission form lave insisted already that\nthe petition is insufficient, they holding\nthat the law demands that the petition\nbe signed by one-fourth of the number\nof electors who voted at the last gen\neral election. T\' iy hold that many\nvotes were cast blank for the office of\nmayor and that the total number of\nall the votes cast was largely in\nexcess of the number received by the\nthree actual candidates. The reading\nof the law appears to be plain and it\nstates that the petitions shall be sign\ned by twenty-five per cent of the votes\ncast for all candidates for mayor. No\nmention of the blank votes is made in\nthe law. This matter has been referred\nto the «city attorney for a decision.\nThe clans have already begun to line\nup for and against the proposed change\nin the form of government of the city.\nMany of the workingmen of the city\nseem to be committed to the new form\nand it has a large support among the\nheavier tax payers of the city. The\nplan is opposed by the men who have\nbeen active in politics as these men\n, seem to prefer the old form.\n“It will take a long while to get\nover these petitions,” said Mayor Head\nin discussing the matter. “There are\na lot of names on them that I have\nnever heard of and I shall be forced\nto refer to poll lists i 1 order to satis\nfy myself that the petitions contain the\nrequisite number of electors. Just as\nsoon as I am convinced that this is true\nI will make the proclamation provided\nby the state law.”\nONE MAN RELEASED.\nJulius Elbi Arrested on Charge of Aid\ning Fugitive Released on Tuesday.\nJulius Elbi, one of the Italians ar\nrested on Monday night on charges of\nhaving aided in the escape of Peter\nCovalla, who was charged with attempt\ned murder, was released on Tuesday\nnight at the order of District Attorney\nAL. Drury. The district attorney held\n; that the evidence was not sufficient to\nhold Elbi for a preliminary hearing in\nthe municipal court. This morning a\nformal complaint was issued for the ar\nrest of James Jendi, who is charged\nwith having furnished the money to\nCovalla to go to Italy. The hearing\nwill be taken up in the municipal court\n■ late this afternoon or Thursday morn\npng. In the meantime active steps are\nbeing taken to locate Covalla in South\nAmerica and it is possible that ha wjj]\nJic brought back for trial.\nKENOSHA, WISCONSIN. JANUARY 8, 1914.\nSHOWS BIG INCREASE\nPostal Receipts of Kenosha\nPostoffice Jump $15,000 in\nthe Year of 1913.\nANNUAL HEPOfIT ISSUED TODAY\nPostmaster and Assistants Are Hopeful\nThat Kenosha Wid Supplant Green\nBay as Sixth in List of Postoffices in\nWisconsin in the Annual Report.\nAssistant Postmaster Michael F.\nZeus today .issued his annual report of\nthe receipts of the Kenosha postoffi.ee\nin the sale of stamps and this report\nshows that the year 1913 brought a re\ncord increase in the business of the\nKenosha postoffice. So great is the in\ncrease that the officials of the local of\nfice are of the opinion and entertain\nhigh hopes that Kenosha will supplant\nGreen Bay as the sixth office in the\nstate in the matter of stamp sales.\nKenosha jumped over Sheboygan in the\nreport made by Postmaster Welch of\nEau Claire, a year ago, and it is expect\ned that the statistics of the state ofiices\nto be issued some time this month will\ngive Kenosha another boost. This will\nmake it sixth with Oshkosh fifth\nand Oshkosh is so far ahead of Keno\nsha that it is feared that it will be\nseveral years before the Kenosha office\ntakes an upward step in the list of the\noffices of the state.\nThe increase in the postal receipts\nof the local office over the receipts in\n1912 is more than fifteen thousand dol\nlars, the largest increase ever showm in\nan annual report. The business of the\nparcel post system is reflected in this\nyear\'s business, but at that the busi\nness of the office for December is only\n$450 greater than the bigness of the\npreceding year. • I!LL-the fir#\nten thousand dollar month in the sale\nof stamps in the Kenosha office, the re\nceipts for the month of May passing\nthe ten thousand mark and being more\nthan $3,000 greater than the receipts in\nthe same month last year.\nThe report sent out this year com\npares the receipts of the office over a\nterm of eleven years. It shows that in\n1902 the receipts of the office (postal)\nwere $22,627.88, considerably less than\none-fourth of the receipts during the\nyear just closed. In 1907 the receipts\nhad jumped to $48,996.67; in 1910 they\nreached $63,855.69; in 1911, $75,361.42;\nin 1912, $83,503.38, and in 1913,\n$98,815.86.\nIt will be noted that the increase in\nthe sales for the last year was within\nseven thousand dollars of the increase\nin the five years from 1902 to 1907.\nThe monthly sales of stamps for 1913,\nas compared with 1912, are as follows:\n1912. 1913.\nJanuary $ 7,338.85 $ 8.591.51\nFebruary 5,518.16 7,244.83\nMarch 8,057.43 9,143.30\nApril 6,155.74 9,208,27\nMay 7,026.72 10,189.08\nJune 5,715.59 7,575.21\nJuly 6,812.44 7,768.93\nAugust 7,074.47 6,564.30\nSeptember 6,443.15 8,272.42\nOctober 7,168.76 7,339.26\nNovember 6,439.95 7,016.36\nDecember 9,455.12 9,905.39\nTotals $83,503.38 $98,815.86\nMUST CARE FOR HYDRANTS.\nWater Commission Would Put Fire Pro\ntection in Charge of Department.\nThe water commission at its regular\nsession on Tuesday night took steps to\nput all work in connection with the\nmaintenance of the fire hydrants under\nthe charge of the chief of the fire de\npartment. In order to make this pos\nsible the commission ds planning to in\nstall special taps, which may be used\nby patrons having contracts for street\nsprinkling and after these taps are put\nin the street sprinklers will not be per\nmitted to take water from the fire\nhydrants under any consideration. The\nmembers of the commission spent more,\nthan an hour discussing filtration plans\nbut nothing of a definite nature was\ndone.

F. Bidin\nger and Postmaster Daniel Grady came\nto Kenosha to be the guests of the\nKenosha Council. They came on a spe\ncial car and they came prepared to\ntake charge of all the proceedings of\nthe evening and when they marched in\nto the council hall the officers of the\nKenosha Council yielded their chairs\nto the visitors and all that the Kenosha\nmembers had to do was to spread the\nglad hand and accept the splendid en\ntertainment provided by the visiting\nknights.\nThe Waukegan team had charge of\nthe regular meeting of tht, council and\nafter the work was completefl Mayor\nBidinger was introduced as master of\nceremonies and for an hour the visit\ning knights put on an entertainment\nthat made the Kenosha members of the\norder sit up and take notice.\nThere were musical numbers and\nvaudeville stunts furnished by the vis\nitors and there were addresses breach\ning fraternal greetings by the Wauke\ngan mayor. Postmaster Grady, Louis\nDurkin, John Broderick. John Reardon\nand James Gallagher. Every one of the\nsp<nkcrs had to say. The\nWaukegan visitors urged a closer rela\ntionship between the members of the\norder in Kenosha and Waukegan, and\nspoke of the common interest of all in\nthe advancement of the Work of the\nKnights of Columbus. There were\ntoasts to the order and to its work in\ntwo of the great states in the union.\nAfter the Waukegan men had sang\nand talked themselves tired the Keno\nsha members showed that they were not\nlacking in hospitality and led the way\nto rhe banquet hall where a dinner was\nserved at which covers were laid for\nmore than 150. After dinner was over\nthere was more talking and more good\nfellowship. The members of the Ke\nnosha Council accepted an invitation to\nhave charge of the next meeting of the\nWaukegan Council, and an effort will\nbe made to have at least a hundred\nKenosha knights visit Waukegan on\nthat occasion.\nThis promises to be a banner year\nfor the Kenosha Council and already\nmore than forty applications have been\nreceived. It is planned to arrange for\nthe initiation of a class of more than\n60 members in about two months and\nthis class initiation will be made the\noccasion of one of the biggest gather\nings ever held by the Kenosha Council.\nBIG SUIT IS SETTLED.\nSIO,OOO Suit Brought by Angelo Copen\nAgainst Brass Co. Dismissed Today.\nIn the municipal cpurt this morning\nJudge Randall handed down a formal\norder dismissing the suit brought by\nAngelo Copen against the Chicago Brass\ncompany in which the plaintiff had de\nmanded damages to the amount of $lO,-\n000. The order for dismissal of the sun\nwas based on a stipulation of the at\ntorneys in the case which indicated\nthat the case had been settled out of\ncourt, but no facts in regard to the na\nture of the settlement were made pub\nlic. The attorneys for the defendant\ncompany had filed a demurrer demand\ning the dismissal of the action and the\nmotion was under consideration by the\ncourt when the notice of settlement\nwas received. Copen lost an eye in an\naccident at the plant of the company\nsome time ago.\nOUTSIDERS SEEKING JOBS.\nWorkmen Coming From Other Cities to\nTake Advantage of Prosperity.\nSpeaking in regard to the number of\nmen out of employment in the city, tba \\\nmanager of the Manufacturers’ Em\nployment bureau makes the statement\nthat out-of-town applicants are coming\nin much faster than they can be placed.\nDuring the first two days of the present\nweek the bureau received applications;\nfrom forty-two machinists, thirty\'\nwoodworkers, sixteen painters, besides\nnumerous other tradesmen. AH this\ngoes to show that the crowded condi- ■\ntion.of the labor market is due more’\nto the influx of outside mechanics than i\nL to idle people al home. t\nSEEK REBATE RELEASES.\nCity Attorney Draws Formal Release\nfor Market Square Paving Rebates.\nThe city officials are planning to ef\nfect an early settlement of the question\nof the payment of rebates for paving\non the south side of Market Square by\nthe, railway company and City Attorney\nSlater is bow drawing releases to be\nsigned by each of the property owners.\nThe city has agreed to pay to the prop\nerty owners one-half of the amount re\nbated by the company. It is claimed\nthat every property owner on the south\nside of the square with a single excep\ntion has agreed to sign the release.\nThe exception will probably be taken\ncare,of by the railway company. Mayor\nHead is anxious to have these releases\nsigned and in the hands of the company\nbefore the next meeting of the council\nin order that a final settlement of all\nthe troubles between the city and the\nrailway company may be made at that\ntime.

It is said that the book re\nferred to in the letter has had a wide\ncirculation io this city and county.\nTo Chief Naturalization Examiners.\nExaminers, Officers of the Naturali\nzation Service, Clerks of Courts ex\nercising jurisdiction in naturalization\nmatters, and others concerned.\nIt has been brought to the attention\nof the department that a publication\nentitled “Syllabus-Digest of Decisions\nUnder the Law of Naturalization of\nthe United States,” purporting to be\nthe work of Jerome C. Shear, chief\nnaturalization examiner at Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania, has been issued and is\nbeing advertised for sale by circular\nletters.\nIn order that the public may not*as\nsume, from the published position and\ntitle of the author, that the contents\nof said publication are, in whole or in\npart, an authoritative expression of the\nofficial administrative view, the depart\nment feels it to be incumbent upon it\nto disavow all responsibility for the\ncontents of said publication. The de\npartment advises all whom it may con\ncern that it alone has authority to de\ntermine whether an official publication\nshould be issued in relation to any law\nover which it has administrative super\nvision, or what, if such publicaton\nshould be issued, its contents should be.\nAll officers of the naturalization\nservice are directed to give this circu\nlar such publicity as may be necessary\nto counteract any misapprehension as\nto the character of Examiner Shear\'s\npublication.\nW.

He de\nclares that to get the greatest ef\n| ficiency from the splendid apparatus\ni provided by the city that more men\n■ are necessary. He seeks to have added\nj men at each of the stations and men\nlto take care of a new station to ba\nbuilt next summer if possible. In addi\ntion to this the chief declares that the\nrebuilding of the fire alarm system is<\n! now a necessity. He holds that during\nI the year alarms have failed to come ini\non account of the condition of the ap\ni paratus at the city hall. His sugges\ntion is that the system be divided into\nsix circuits in order to make it easier\nto locate the breaks. At the present\ntime there are but two circuits. He sug\ngests the installation of a six circuit*\ni repeater and the exchanging nf the\nI nresent two circuit switch board for anj\nj C\'ght circtl L . board. JSit\'h changes\n•Auld no s <J; ,v f or |]j e\ndiate demands of the department, but\'\nalso for the future. He asks that the\ncity provine at once for the installation!\nof eight new fire alarm boxes. The’\ncouncil has already taken up the ques\ntion of the erection of a new station 1\non West Grand avenue and the mem\nbers of the council are divided as to\nthe necessity of such an expenditure at\nthis time but it is not improbable that*\nthe new house will be ordered before 1\nthe end of the present year. No ap\n\' propriation has leen made for the erec-\nI tion of the horse in the annual budget\ni of the citv. tut this is not a bar to the\nbuilding of the house as there was no\nappropriation made for the new build*\ning in the third ward recently com\ni pleted.\nThe annual report of the chief con\ntains a lot of interesting statistics. It\nshows that the value of apparatus own\ned by the city for fire purposes is well\nover $25,000 and that Kenosha has the\nonly complete motor fire service to be\nfound in the state of Wisconsin. The\nreal estate and buildings owned by the\ncity and used for the fire department\nare value at $50,000. The report shows\nthat during the year the department was\ncalled out ninety-nine times and of this\nnumber of calls but twenty were box\ncalls. The total loss on buildings and\nstocks during the year amounted to\n$8,820 and this loss was covered by an.\ninsurance of many times its amount.\nThe majority of the fires attended dur\ning the year were small blazes in which\nthe loss was less than SSO and the larg\nest loss reported was $2,000. This loss’\nwas entirely covered by insurance.\nThe financial report is interesting.\nIt shows thai the cost of maintenance\nof the department for the year was\n$29,946.47. Of this amount $14,712.52\nwas paid out in salaries to the members\nof the department and $7,518.65 was\nexpended for real estate and buildings.\nThe expenses for apparatus during the\nfiscal year amounted to $4,861.74, this\nbeing the amount paid for new appara\ntus after deducting the amounts re\nalized by the city by sale of old;\napparatus.\nIn his report the chief pays high tri\nbute to the work of the men under him,\'\ndeclaring that they have at all times\nbeen faithful to their duties and that\nthey have rendered most efficient’\nservice to the city.\nThe recommendations of the chief\nwill be taken up at an early meeting\nof the council.\nThe jury which heard the ei iilenee ia\nthe suit of John Stocker vs. Adam Win\ntieski and others, reached a verdict late\non Tuesday afternoon finding for the\nplaintiff and fixing the amount he should\nrecover at $65.25.\nThe Kenosha and Racinr high school\nbasketball teams will clash in the first\ngame of the season in Racine on Friday\nevening.

Besonders kraß ist die Wir\nkung der neuen Kleidervorschrist an\njenem Oktobertage des Jahres her\nvorgetreten, wo die Prä\nsidcntschast mitrat. Es liegen darü\nber recht erheiternde Berichte vor. Tie\n„verbotene Stadt" mit ihrer Farben\npracht bot sonst bei festlichen Gete\ngenheiten ein herrliches Bild, man\ndenke an die bunten, Lrokatenen ober\nseidenen Fcsigcwänücr, an Pccten und\nStickereien, und sielte sich vor, daß an\nStelle dessen das eintönige Schwarz\nder e\'.iropa.chcn Kleivung getreten ist.\nAllein, was für eine europäische Klei\ndung! Die chinesischen Schneider\nhatten sich gewiß aste erdenkliche Mühe\ngegeben, ihrc Landsleute richtig aus\nzuputzen, allein gelangen war cs ih\nnen nicht: von oben bis unten steck\nten die Chinesen nicht in Kleidern,\nsondern in Karikaturen von Kleidern.\nNatürlich trugen sie Zvtinderhüte, Zy\nlinderhüie in jeglicher Hohe, nur inchl\nin der in Europa üolichen, aus zeg\nlichem Stoff, nur nicht dem, den die\nAbendländer dazu verwenden. Und\nwie man einen Zylinder zu tragen\nhat, wußten sie natürlich auch nicht.\nEinige hasten ihre Behauptungen bis\nauf die Ohren heruntergezogen, an\ndere suchten sie unmittelbar über den\nAugenbrauen im Gleichgewicht zu\nhalten, vielen aber spielte die An\nziehungskraft Ler Erde einen argen\nStreich unv z>rng sie fortgesetzt,\ndurch Nachhelfen mit den Händen das\nverlorengehende Gleichgewicht aufs\nneue wieder h-rzustesten. Ler fest\nliche Tag war nämlich windig und\nregnerisch.\nTie Fräcke und Gehröcke, die die\nChinesen trugen, paßten vollkommen\nzu diesen Hüten: man sah solche aus\nglänzend schwarzem Alpakastoff. aus\nSeide und allen möglichen anderen\nGeweben, nur nicht aus Kammgarn\nunv Tuch, wie im Abendlande. Bon\neiner „Fasson" im Sinne eines eu\nropäischen Schneiders war auch nicht\nallzuviel zu entdecken, denn die Grö\nßenverhältnissc der einzelnen Teile\nzu einander waren meistens mißlun\ngen, und man sah Nocke, die lächerlich\nkurz waren, uno anocre, deren Schöße\nbis aus die S:.: :I hingen.\nAm meisten , cywierigteiten hasten\naugenscheinlich K:.- cn und K.-nvatte\nbereitet.

I. Fischer\nin den Abhandlungen der Geographi\nschen Gesellschaft in Wien gegeben.\nHiernach zeichn.n sich besonders d:e\nnördlichen Gestade des Miticlmecrs\ndurch submarine Quellen aus. In\nden Buchten von EanneS und Antivcs\nsowie vor der Mündung des Var sin\nden sich untermeerische Quellen, die\nsich bei ruhiger See durch Aufwallen\nverraten. Auch in der Umgebung r\nRhonemünduiigkn treten submarine\nQuellen und oft in beiräckttichec\nTiefe auf. Die mächtigste ist die von\nPort Miou bei Cassis, sie bricht aus\neinem der 2 Quadratmeter großen\nFelsentore mit solcher Gewalt hervor,\ndaß sie an der Mccresorftäche einen\nStrom hervorruft, der schwimmende\nGegenstände oft über 2 Kilometer weit\nforttreibt. Im Golf von Spezia gidt\nes eine Anzahl zudmariner Queucn,\nvon denen ine so mächtig ist, daß sic\nan der Oberfläche der See einen\nWafferhügel erzeugt, der für kleine\nFahrzeugs unnahbar ist. Zahlreich-\'\nuntermeerische Quellen gibt es längs\nder Küsten von Istrien und Dalma\ntien.\nWenden wir uns nach Amerika, \'o\ntreffen wir auf die auch von Hum\nboldt geschilderten gewaltigen Süß\nwafserqucllcn in der Bucht von Ta\ngua und Kuba. Sie treten mit gro\nßer Kraft an der Meeresoberfläche\nhervor, und bisweilen ergänzen dort\nSchiffe ihren Vorrat an Süßwafler.\nZwischen den Rissen, welche die höh\nlenreichen Bahama-Jnseln umgeben,\nquillt klares, frisches süßes Quell\nwasser empor, das um so reiner und\nkälter ist, je tiffer e- geschöpft wird.\nZur Zeit der Ebbe kann man die\nQuellen deutlich sehen und das Was\nser da schöpfen, wo es aus dem Bo\nden emporsprudelt. In der Nähe der\nInsel Saba in den Kleinen Antillen\nwurde mitten im Meer das Vorhan\ndensein einer bedeutenden Süßwasser\nmasse entdeckt, die in konzentrischen\nKreisen vom Meeresboden aufzuquel\nlen schien. Nahe der Küste von Uuka\ntan gibt es untermeerische Tüßwasser\nquellen, die ihrc Wasser nicht in\nschmalen Becken mir einer gewissen\nGeschwindigteit ausströmen, icnstern\ngewissermaßen ausgebreireicn Seen\ngleichen, die keine merkliche Strömung\nzeigen. Diese Sützwassermaffrn schei\nnen landeinwärts eine große \'Ausdeh\nnung zu besitzen, denn dort befinden\nsich natürliche Brunnen, zu denen die\nAnwohner aus Leocrii durch küu\'ilicke\nund natürliche Schächte bina:steigen,\num sich den Bedarf an Triiikwasser\nzu holen.\nEine merkwürviae hierhin gehörige\nErscheinung sin! stch Lei Reclus.\nIm Januar 18.17 war das ganze\nMeer an der Südspitze von Florida\nder Schauplatz eines acwastigen Süß\nwosser Ausbruch-.

Secretary and Treasurer, j\nDated January 13,1914. *\nESTABLISHED 1856\nBE SURE OF YOUR FOOTING\nJohn Stoll Doost Vernon County and\n“Old Wisconsin’’\nPasadena, California, January 2.\nFriend Munson: Just a few lines\nthrough the CENSOR, to my inquiring\nfriends: lam rot selling any real es\ntate, but have had a grand trip for the\npast ten days We went to Chicago in\nthe snow on the 23d of December. In\na short time were on the bare land again\nin Illinois. On the morning of the 24th\nwe had plenty of snow again, which\nlasted to nearly Sacr. ento City, Cali\nfornia, and plenty of it, and winter\nright. Part of the way was like real\nWisconsin winter weather. We spent\nChrisimas and the next day in Salt Lake\nCity looking over many things new to\nus. The temple square containing the\ntemples and tabernacle and its bureau\nof information, all of which we were\nglad to be shown. Also were in St.\nMary’s cathedral and at many other\npoints of interest.\nWe landed at San Francisco on Sun\nday morning, leaving winter behind,\nwhere sunshine and rain have made\nplenty of green grass, which looks fine\nfor winter time. While in San Fran\ncisco I met Frank Onley, formerly of\nViola, who think* that part of Califor\nnia is the only country. Mr. Onley said\nit had been too dry since 1909, only\nwhere they could irrigate the land, and\nthe rain was what they wanted. Since\nleaving San Francisco I see they are\nhaving floods and washouts, trains laid\nup and many of the farmers in low lands\nwiped out of house and home in the val\nleys of upper California.\nWe spent two days in Frisco observ\ning what could be seen by tourists, (or\ncountry people as they call us) went\nthrough Chinatown, where they claim\nthirty thousand Chinamen,and of which\nplenty were small ones. We left for\nLob Angeles and Pasadena arriving on\nJanuary Ist, 1914, and from this far-olf\ncity we wish one and all at home a hap\npy and prosperous New Year. We\nwatched the grand parade of the rose\ntournament. There were some grand\nfloats, and many of them. The parade\nlasting over an hour, as we were in one\nplace all that time. In the afternoon\nwe were at the park where there were\nmany races—chariot, hurdle and foot\nracing, high jumping, many things of\ninterest which made the first day of the\nyear a busy one for us. >\nIt is all right and fine at this time of\nthe year and we enjoy being here. The\nfreeze of 1913 was bad for the ranchers\nhere and I am of the opinion farming\nis not in its highest state. There is\nlots of wealth but I am of the strong\nopinion a great deal of it was made in\nthe east. At any rate, Viroqua and\nVernon county looks good to us, and\nnowhere have we seen any more pros-\nBerous country than old Wisconsin.\n(any who have been in the west for\nyears will hardly believe in the advance\nin the enst. but I for one can tell them\nof the modern farm homes, and that\nour farmers of today are on the top\nrow with the cash in their jeans, and\nthe best is none too good for them.\nUps and downs hit most of us some\ntime in life, no matter where we go.\nTb- whole thing in this life is in being\nsatisfied and contented, and this leads\nme to say: be sure you have something\n1 letter than Vernon county before you\nmake any change, as Wisconsin and\nVernon county are to me at the head of\nthe list. Mv wife says to me “be a\nbooster for Wisconsin.” That is what\nthey do in Pasadena.\nYours, J. E. Stoll.\nRoger the Whole Works\nHon. Roger Williams of Hillsboro,\nwho, as justice, lias doubtless married\nmore couplea than any man in Vernon\ncounty, gives notice how to wed with\nout license er medical examination. In\nthe Sentry he advertises:\n“To all those who contemplate mar\nriage in future and wish to wed under a\nsolemn contract, which is binding and\nlawful under the laws of this state, I\nwill draw up for them. The common\nlaw prevails in this state. All that is\nnecessary to do for two people who wish\nto be married is to make b written\nstatement, before witnesses, that they\ntake each other as man and wife. You\ndon’t require any license, medical ex\namination, priest, clergyman or magis\ntrate.”\nDetermined to Hoist Head Officers\nModern Woodmen everywhere are\nsounding the slogan for defeat of pres\nent head officers of the society, who\nwere instrumental in attempting to\nforce the outrageous increase in rates.\nThe local camps will elect delegates at\nthe first meeting in February to attend\na county convention to be held in Viro\nqua later. Camps are entitled to ore\ndelegate for each 26 members. Every\nWoodman in the county should attend\nthe meeting cf his local camp at the\nfirJt February meeting and have a full\nrepresentation at the county convention.\nThe unhorsing of head officers can only\nbe accomplished by moral support and\ndetermination of members.\nChance for More State Inspectors\nIce cream dealers and traders in oys\nters ate now required tn conform with\nanew regulation by the weight and\nmeasures department of the state. Pa\nper ice cream and oyster containers\nmust be filled to a certain height and\nbe marked by a perforated line accom\npanied by the words" Fill to the Mark.”\nThe capacity of the paper bucket must\nalso be plainly indicated on tbe side or\ntop.\nImportant to Threshermen\nAnnual convention of the Wisconsin\nBrotherhood of Threshermen will be\nheld in Madison city January 20th and\n21st. Every tbresherman in the state,\nwhether a member of the association or\nnot, is welcome to attend this conven\ntion and the special attraction on the\nevening of the 20th in the shape of a\n“Dutch Lunch” and smoker. Drop a\npostal card to The American Thresher\nman, Madison, and get your name in\nthe pot.\nToo Sudden for Comfort\nArrival of zero weather for this sea\nson was delayed till January 12th, when\npeople were astonished to arise and find\nthe mercury registering ten below.\nSunday was warm and pleasant, water\nstanding in the roads and automobiles\nmade their rounds as freely as in June.\nThe change was too sudden for com\nfort.\nInsurance Company Officers\nUtica farmers\' mutual insurance com\npany held annual meeting at Readstown\non Friday.

Er stirbt unter der Sand\nwelle, die seinen Wafferlauf allmählich\nverschüttet, einen Lauf, der für die\nEwigkeit bestimmt schien. Aber lang\nsam ist der Euphrat vor den eindrin\ngenden Sandmassen zurückgewichen,\nund jetzt rüstet er sich vollends zum\nSterben, wie vor ihm die Wunder\nstädte dahingesiecht sind, die sich an\nseinen Ufer erhoben. So verschwin\ndet mit ihm eins der Weltwunder, das\nder Phantasie die lachendsten Bilder\nvon Glück und Wohlstand vorzaubert;\ndenn mit dem Nil zusammen ist der\nEuphrat der berühmteste Fluß der\nErde, der die älteste Zivilisation der\n„heidnischen Welt blühen und ver\ngehen sah." Ja, die jüngsten Ent\ndeckungen haben sogar den Beweis er\nbracht, daß er überhaupt wohl die\nälteste Zivilisationsquelle darstellt,\nweil allem Anscheine nach die Begrün\nder des Pharaonenreichcs vom Persi\nschen Golf kamen. Es war die chal\ndäiscke Technik, die der ägyptischen\nKunst die Mittel zu ihrer Entwick\nlung gab.\nMesopotamien war im Innern eine\nvon der Sonne ausgedörrte Wüste,\nund allein die Kanalisierung des\nEuphrats brachte es fertig, diese\nWüste der Kultur zugänglich zu ma\nchen. Jahrhunderte gingen darüber\nhin, bis das Werk zustande gekommen\nund die Wüste zum Ackerland gewor\nden war. das große Städte erstehen\nund blühen sah. Die Hartnäckigkeit\nund die Kraft des Menschen haben\nhier die Natur überwunden; aber bald\nkam die Zeit der moralischen und po\nlitischen Entartung, die alles verän\nderte. Als die menschliche Energie\nder Verweichlichung Platz machte,\ntrocknete der Boden wieder aus, und\nder Sand nahm vom Wasserlaufe\nBesitz. Unter dem Staubregen star\nben die Wunderstädte dahin und erst\nvor etwa fünfzig Jahren gelang cs\nden Archäologen, die versunkenen\nStädte von Ninive und Babylon wie\nner ans Licht des Tages zu bringen.\nDamit erwachte auch der Euphrat zu\nneucr Tätigkeit. Unzäh\'ige Ladun\ngen von Terrakotten und Statuen\nund Kunsttlümmern gelangten auf\nibm zur Verschiffung. Doch es war\nnur ein kurzes Eintagsleben. das dem\nfteiligen Strome betchieden war. Heute\ntiezt er wieder still, vergessen, und\nrüstet sich endgültig zum Sterben, aus\ndem es kein neues Erwachen gibt.\nf Nordileä or Sroiit, 81.\nNach Fort Bliß.\nSekretär Garrison ordnete die Hefter\nführunz der mexikanischen Sol\ndaten dorthin an.\nWashington.

Tie Alttounfälle haben sich\nin der letzten Zeit derart gehäuft, daß\ndie Richter sich entschlossen haben, Haft\nftraftn an Stelle der Geldstrafe zu\nverhänge, um dem Uedelstand abzu\nhelfen.\nD.u iruM und Mcr.\nProfessor Metschnikow Arbeitet, wie\nbekann\', im Pariser Pasteurinstftrit\nseit langem daran, die Ursachen des\nfrühzeitigen Alterns zu ergründen.\nDie Beobachtung, daß die Lebens\nlange der Tiere im umgekehrten Ver\nhältnis zu der Länge ihres Dickdarms\nsteht, führt Metschnikow zu der Ver\nmutung, daß die im Darm vegetieren\nden Bakterien an dem vorzeitigen Ver\nfall unseres Organismus die Schuld\ntragen. Die von diesen Mikroben\nproduzierten Gifte sollen die Ursache\nunseres kurzen Lebens und der\nKrankheit unseres Alters sein. Tier\nversuche ergaben Degenerations-Er\nscheinungen und sogar Tötung der\nTiere durch solche Darmgifte. Zum\nBeispiel verursacht das Indol, ein\nProdukt der Darmfäulnis, das als\nlangsam wirkendes Gift die bekannten\nAkterserscheinungen hervorruft, vor\nallem die Arteriosklerose, die chronische\nEntzündung der Nieren, kurzum Er\nscheinungen, die für den im Alter ein\ntretenden Verfall charakteristisch sind.\nMetschnikow schlug zuerst, um die\nProduktion solcher Gifte in unserem\nDarm und damit die Altersdegenera\ntion zu bekämpfen, vor. Milchsäure\nbakterien zu verspeisen, da Säure den\nFäulnisprozeß hindert. Diese brau\nchen aber einen zuckerhaltigen Nähr\nboden. Nun dringt der mit der Nah\nrung ansgenommene Zucker nur höchst\nselten dis in die unteren Darmpar\ntien, und die Milchsäurebakterien ver\nmögen daher gerade an der wichtigsten\nStelle den Kampf gegen die Fäulnis\nbakterien nicht aufzunehmen. Es\nmußte danach, wie die „Naturwissen\nschaftliche Wochenschrift" berichtet,\nversucht werden, eine Produktions\nquelle von Zuckerstoff im Dickdarm\nselbst zu finden. In der Tat konnte\nein Darmbakterium ermittelt wer\nden, das Zucker aus Stärke bildet,\nohne die Eiweißkörper anzugreifen.\nDas zuckerbildende Bakterium paßte\nsich den Verhältnissen im menschlichen\nDarm überaus aut an und erwies\nsich absolut unschädlich, und di In\ndol- und Phenolbildung im Darm\nwurde sowohl bei Tieren wie bei\nMenschen bedeutend herabgesetzt. Zur\nUnterstützung der Wirkung empfiehlt\nes sich. Kartoffeln in jeder Zuberei\ntung zu essen. Außerdem ist es not\nwendig. den Fleiscbgenuß soweit wie\nmöalich einzus ranken. Das zucker\nbildende Bakterium lüdet den denkbar\nbc\'\'en Nährboden für das Wachstum\nund die Anffcd\'.nng der Müchffä\'. rQ:k\nterien im Darm. und erst im Zumm\nmcnwirken bien:\',:; erzielt man die\nvolle Wirkung.\nBcrMlicitcr-ft>iuct\nI\nIceue kosincoittraktc sind die l>aupl\naufgabe der Nniked INine I\'Oor\nkers os America.\nIndianapolis, Jnd., 18.

Wie viele wissen aber, was\ndieses Wort eigenNich bedeutet? so\nfragt Adolf Stöbet in einem hübschen\nAufsätze über Volksetymologie, Und\ndoch hat Jeder, der darüber mit un\ntergeschlagenen Armen nachsinnt, im\nwahrsten Sinne des Wortes die\nBretzel vor sich, denn sic ist nichts an\nderes als eine Nachbildung seiner un\nterschlagenen Arme, freilich imKleinen.\nDenn sonst würde sie Bretze heißen.\nBretze ist nach Jakob Grimm „ein in\nGestalt untergeschlagener Arme ge\nbackener Brotring und Bretzel die Ver\nkleinerungsform. Dies Wort ist aber\nnicht urdeutsch, sondern es kam zu uns\naus Italien, und hängt mit dem\nitalienischen „braccio" zusammen."\nDie Italiener nannten nun dieses\nnach beiden Armen geformte Gebäck\nmit dem Plural „bracci", und daraue\nentwickelte sich das deutsche Bretze-\nGebäck. von dem nur noch das Dimi\nuulivum Bretzel erhalten geblieben ist\nEine unverkennbare Verwandtschaft\nhat die Bretzel, die gewiß Verhältniß\nmäßig jungen Ursprunges ist, mb\neinem einfacheren und viel älteren Ge\nbäck, das von seiner Gestalt her einer,\nurdeutschen Namen trägt. Es bilde!\neinen Kreis, einen Ring, und heißt\ndeshalb Ring oder Kring, woraus\ndann genau wie bei der Bretzel die\nBerkleinerungssorm Kringel sich bil\ndete. Ter „Kring" als Gebäck ist\naber noch nicht lange ausgestorben.\nNochum 1780 schrieb z. B, Merck aus\nDarmstadt an Goethe: „Meine Frau\nläßt schon einen Pfingstkringen mehr\nfür Sie backen", und in dem 1865\nerschienen „Namenbüchlein" von Vil\nmar erscheint sogar noch der „Rinken\nbäckcr", der die „Riim-" macht. Es\nist sehr begreiflich, daß sich erst in\nverhälinißmäßig später Zeit die Di\nminutivformen zur Bezeichnung der\nGebäcke herausgebildet haben. Denn\ndie ältest.n Gebäcke zeigten sicherlich,\nwie die einfachste Gestalt, so auch ein\ngroßes Maß; erst später sind sie dann\nkle.n und in der Form künstlich ge\n! vordem\nCrosse.

NEWS\n. ATTENDANCE AND TARDINESS.\nAs has been reported in this column\nbefore, the record of attendance and\ntardiness iu Lancaster is probably\nvery much better than in most places\nin the state. And yet in Lancaster\nihere are a large number of cases that\nare not entirely necessary. In the\ncase of tardiness, especially in the\ngiades, great care ought to be taken\nby parents to get children started in\ntune and to urge upon them the\nnecessity of being on time. Lately\nat the North school the tardines-i has\nbeen quite general, many being from\nfive to tbiity minutes late, and all\nwithout good reason. The pupils who\nare tardy most often are those who\ncould have reached the school on time\nif they had made an effort The\nteachers have tried to correct the\nmatter, but the co-operation of the\nparents is needed to secure results.\nA child who is reared to come and go\nat his will, will become the victim\nof a tendecy that does much to injure\nhis poseibe success.\nA summary of the records in the\nhigh school shows that for the first\nfour months of the year, thirty pupils\nbave neither been absent nor tardy.\nOf these seven are boys; the best\npercentage of attendance ie in tbe\nFreshman class, wtich out of a\npresent enrollment of thiry-seven has\nfourteen without any loss of time.\nTHE HIGH SCHOOL EXAMINATIONS.\nOn Thursday and Friday. Jan. 22\nand 23, the final semester examina\ntions in the highschool will be held\nThose who have been doing their\ndaily work faithfully bave nothing to\nfear from these tests, but for others\ntbe finals may spell failure, as they\ncount one-fourth with the daily work\nand the monthly tests for tbe\ndetermination of the final average.\nAny pupil who falls below 65 in\neither his tests or his daily work or\nwhose average of test and daily work\nis below 75, fails in his work for the\nsemester and must take the subject\nagain. To seniors, therefore, it is a\nmatcter of graduation.\nA new plan for rbetorical work in\nthe high school was explained to tbe\nstudents last Friday. For tbe second\nsemester of the year, all the pupils in\ntbe school are to be divided into\nfive classes, each of which is to be in\ncharge of a teacher. These divisions\nwill meet separately once each week\nfor their work in public speaking.\nThe same rules will apply to this\ndepartment of work that govern every\nether subject in the school; pupils\nmust attend their division regularly\nand must do their work thoroughly\nand satisfactorily, for records are to\nbe kept, and failure in rhetoricals\nwill prevent graduation just as in any\nother subject.\nFor the seniors the work will con\nsist largely of writing and speaking\ntheir orations; in the other classes,\nit will be the recitation of declama\ntions, debates, extempore speeches,\nand other forms of address.\nRegular drill is to begin next week.\nMr. Frank Meyer spoke before the\nhigh school assembly last Wednesday\nmorning on lack of interest that the\npupils showed in their activities.\nHe condemned tbe attitude of boys\nand girls in school who expected\neverything to be done for them rather\nthan do for themselves, and who com\nplained because opportunities were\nnot furnished them for amusement\nHe recommended strongly that pupils\nget interested in things, and that\nthrough that interest, they get for\nthemselves the things they think they\nought to have.\nFORTY-ONE MILLION\nTO PAY ALL TAXES.\nWisconsin Tax Commission Completes\nTabulation Showing Enormous\nSize of Tax Budget.\nMadison, Wis.—The state tax\ncommission announced today tbe re\nsults of tabulations of Wisconsin\ntaxes for 1914. Total taxes of all\nkinds, state and local, for this year\namount to $41,496,960.21, and the\nstate assessment from which this tax\nwas derived was $2 998,187,705. The\ntax rate is computed at .01387403466.\nComparison of these figures with\ntbcse for last year show an increase of\ntaxes amounting to $7,973,547 30. Tbe\ntotal assessed valuation last year was\n$2,841,630,416, tbe total taxes $33,-\n623,412,919, and the tax rate\n.01183243701. This increase is slight\nly more than two mills, equivalent to\n$2.04 for sl,o’oo of true valuation.\nAn interesting observation in this\nconnection is the fact that the IN\nCREASE in taxes of all kinds this\nyear is greater than tbe TOTAL\namount of taxes paid for the year 1879\n—an interval of 35 years.\nSEVEN TOWNS APPEAL\nTO TAX COMMISSION\nAre Not Satisfied With The Equaliza\ntion Values Made by the\nCounty Board\nThe town of Clifton filed an appeal\nMonday from tbe equalization figures\nreported for tbat town, including tbe\nvillage of Livingston, by tbe equaliza\ntion committee of tbe county board.\nThis makes a total of seven towns in\ntbe county that have so appealed, the\nothers being Marion, Castle Rock,\nBoscobel. Bloomington, Millville and\nNorth Lancaster.\nA, preliminary hearing in these\nmatters will he held at tbe court\nbouse in Lancaster, before representa\ntives of tbe state tax commission on\nFriday, February 6, at 10 o’clock a.\nm., to examine tbe assessments of\ntaxable property in the various towns\nunder dispute and to determine\nwhether such appeal shall be enter\ntained and a review of such equaliza\ntion ordered as provided by statute.\nMr. A. E. James, of Madison,\nstatistician of the state tax cimmis\nsion, has been at the court house\nhere for several days past, examining\nthe records for land descriptions in\n‘the town of Potosi, it being represent\ned tbat there are quite a number of\nerrors in tbe description of some of\ntbe lands.\nFISH AND GAME SHIPMENTS\nPostmaster General Burleson Announces\nParcel Post Rulings.\nThe state fish and game com\nmission last week received word from\nPostmaster General Burleson relative\nto tbe new law governing the ship\ninent of dead fish and game by parcel\npost. The postoffice officials hold\nthat no dead sis hor game which has\nbeen killed illegally may be sent\nthrough tbe mails and tbat tbe laws\nof the state specify tbat postmasters\nshall not accept for mailing any\nparcel containing tbe dead bodies or\nparts thereof any wild animals which\nhave been offered for shipment in\nviolation of the laws of the state ter\nritory or district in which they were\nkilled. Provided, however that the\nforegoing shall not be construed to\nprevent tbe acceptance for mailing of\nany dead animals or birds killed dur\ning tbe season when tbe same may be\nlawfully captured.\nIt was also stated tbat tbe postoffice\nauthorities have the right to inspect\nall parcels placed in their care for\ntransportation, and when tbe packages\nare found to contain dead fish or\ngame shipped out of season, steps for\nthe punishment of the offender can be\nstarted under the federal laws.\nStock Shipments.\nWednesday—J.

Bryhan, farmer. 1 car hogs,\nGeo. J. Wieland, farmer, 1 car cattle;\nW. E. Shimmin, farmer, 1 car cattle.\nThere being an insufficient supply of\ncars one car-load of hogs was left ov\ner for subsequent shipment.\nWedding invitations, printed or\nengraved, at this office.\nMethods Successful in Winning Corn\nContest.\nPure seed, good soil and careful at\ntention to the crop are the three prin\ncipal things to which I attribute tbe\nhonor of winning first place in tbe\ncorn-raising contest. I don't claim\nany “state championship. ’ This was\na connty competition. However. I\nunderstand that my record, 133 bushels\nand 38 pounds of corn produced on one\nacre, is the best production of any\nofficially observed. The best previous\nrecord was 13 bushels and 39 pounds\nless than mine.\n[ live in the Town of Eden, and\nwhile we call this “God’s country,”\nthere are many other localities in\nWisconsin, where with similar condi\ntions and equally good seed and care,\nperhaps fully as large yields would\nresult. We had 195 competitors in\nour contest and the general average\nwas so high as to demonstrate the\nwisdom of planting corn in Wiscon\nsin, and more to tbe point tbe wisdom\nof careful selection of seed and giv\ning tbe field tne best possible care.\nMy seed was the Golden Glow variety,\nNo. 12, pure bred. I obtained it from\nJ. P. Bonzelet, and it came from the\nuniversity of Wisconsin Experiment\nstation in 1907. It was planted on\nunusually good clay loam, brought to\na high state of fertility by rotation of\ncrops.\nI selected an acre on the outside of\na forty acre field of corn, and kept\nbusy. Throughout the season I paid\nstrictest attention to the corn, weed\ning it carefully, hill by bill, hoeing\nit by band and also cultivating it\nwith a team plow. The plants never\nstopped growing until sjme of them\nattained a height of ten feet, but\nmany of tbe stalks that made good\nwars were only five feet in height.\nWhen the grain was mature I got the\ncrop into barn in good weather and\ndid tbe husking by hand. I consider\ntbe final results ample reward for tbe\nadditional labor spent over tbe amount\ntne ordinary field gets for I figure the\naverage cost of this corn at only 10*£\ncents a bushel.\nThis experiment convinces me that\nscientific farming is the only proper\nway to get the best respite; 1 have not\nsold tbe crop but it is worth in tbe\nneighborhood of SIOO or $l5O, accord\ning to how much of it is sold as seed.\nThis particular lot is in demand by\nseedsmen simply because it won tbe\nprize, and possibly it will bring a\nhigher price for that reason, but any\n133 bushels of such high quality corn\nwould doubtless bring SIOO which is a\nrather good return on one acre of\nground and aboutsls worth of work.\nMilwaukee Journal.\n—The third anniversary of the\ndedication of the M.

Glass of\nAlabama is not to be seated to succeed\nthe late Senator Johnston, the senate\ncommittee on elections determined\nthat the seventeenth amendment is\nnow in full effect; that no supplement\nal legislation by legislatures is neces\nsary, and that the governor of a state\nhas authority to call a special election\nwhere machinery for such an election\nexists.\nThe senate will pass upon the cc.n\nmittee’s report today.\nIn the Maryland case one Republic\nan, Senator Kenyon of lowa, voted\nwith six Democratic members to seat\nMr. Lee. In the Alabama case only\nSenator Bradley, Republican, of Ken\ntucky, favored seating Mr. Glass. Dem\nocratic leaders expect opposition from\nthe Republican side before a vote is\nreached on the Maryland case.\n“The two cases.” said Chairman\nKern, “were vastly different. In the\nAlabama case proponents of Mr. Glass\nmaintained that the seventeenth\namendment was not in effect because\nthe legislature had not met to supple\nment it with machinery to carry it out\nand that therefore the old laws were\nin force. In the Maryland case, the\nvalidity of the amendment was recog\nnized and effort to carry it out through\nexisting election machinery, a course\nwhich was ratified by a majority of the\nvoters of the state. In Alabama, the\namendment was ignored and in Mary\nland it was sought to carry out the\nspirit of the amendment.”\nGlass was appointed by Governor\nO’Neal to fill the unexpired term of\nSenator Johnston, who died after the\ndirect elections amendment had be\ncome a part of the constitution.\nIn the Maryland case Governor\nGoldsborough called a primary elec\ntion and Blair Lee was victorious. In\nthis case it was declared that the elec\ntion was irregular because it had not\nbeen called by the legislature, but the\ncommittee held that Mr. Lee was en\ntitled to his seat because he was\nchosen by direct vote of the people.\nRelics of Wagner Stolen.\nRelics of Wagner, the great com\nposer, were stolen from the family\nhome, Villa Wahnfried. at Bayreuth,\nGermany, on a recent night.

Ground.\nPaper Written by Ernest Wichern, Son of Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Wichern\nand Read Before the Skillet Creek Farmers’ Club\nThere was clover on the bind laßt\nyear. The first crop was cut for hay\nand the second was cut for seed. The\nnext spring about twenty tons of\nstable manure were hauled on the land\nand plowed in the latter part of May.\nThe ground was harrowed and the\ncorn planted about the first of June*\nThe corn came up iu a few days and\nwfien it was about four inches high it\nwas dragged crosswise as the corn\nwas drilled in. After the corn was\nhigh enough to cultivate I went\nthrough it with the sulkey cultivator,\nthis being about the middle of June.\nAbout ten days later the com was\ngone through again with the same\ncultivator. A week after this we\nstarted hoeing it. The rows were\nplanted three feet, eight inches apart,\nand the corn was very thick in the\nrow. As we hoed it we thinned the\nstalks out to about twelve inches\napart. It took two or three weeks to\nget it all hoed because it seemed hard\nto stick to the job. It it had bsen hoed\nand thinned sooner there would have\nbsen a larger yield.\nThere was nothing done with the\ncorn after this until husking time£\nNumerous\nterritorial\nResidents\nDiscovered\nSince our last report several new\nnames have been added to the News\nTerritorial club.

After the stalks were knocked\ndown the chickens and little pigs\nfound that it was a good place to get\ntheir meals. The Saturday before the\nfair we husked the corn, allowing\nseventy five pounds to the bushel.\nThe corn yield of the country could\nbe greatly increased if the corn could\nbe taken care of in the right way and\nat the right time.\n(Editor\'s Note—ln the corn contest\nconducted by County Superintendent\nG. W. Davies, Walter Klip3tein of\nLoganville look first prize and Ernest\nWichern second. The average yield\nin the United States is 23 bushels,\nin Wisconsin 40 bushels and in the\ncontest 100. The highest in the con\ntest was 122 bushels and the lowest\nabout 82 bushels. Master Wichern\nraised nearly 121 bushels and had it\nDot been for the invaders he would\nno doubt have taken first prize. As\nshown in this case it is cot only good\nfarooingto raise a fine crop but to care\nfor it as well.

Editor and Punisher.\nVALUABLE TOPIC FOR FARMER\nBUSINESS METH\nODS ON THE FARM\nEvery Up-to-date Farmer Should\nTake an Inventory of His\nFarm Now.\nThe Leader has adopted anew feature\nin its endeavor to be especially value\naide to the farmer and will each month\npublish p irts of the Wisconsin Bankers\nfarm bulletin, having been requested to\ndo so by the Farmers & Citizens Hank.\nThe for ming article on Inventories is\nan especially valuable one and should be\ncot out aud saved for reference.\nAn inventory is a statement showing\nin detail the value of land, buildings,\nlivestock, equipment, produce, cash on\nhand and in the bank on the date of in\nventory, together with the amounts of\nall notes and bills that others owe to the\nfarmer as well as those that the farmer\nowes others.\nWhy take an Inventory?\nAn inventory shows, lirst, the farmers\ntotal investment, second, his net worth,\nthird, how much his net worth has in\ncreased or decreased during the year.\nThe total investment is determined by\nadding together th e values of the various\nclasses of property. On this invest\nment the farm must pay a fair rate of\ninterest before there is any return for\nlabor. It is often desirable to know\nhow much of the total capital is invest\ned in horses, land, buildings, etc., and\nby a proper grouping of the farm prop\nerty the annual inventory will furnish\nthe most excellent material for such\nstudy. In case there are no debts, the\nnet worth will be the same as the total\ninvestment; but on farms where there\nare debts these must be subtracted\nfrom the total investment. By compar\ning the net worth of the inventory at\nthe beginning of the year and the net\nworth of that at the end of the year, the\nfarmer can see how much he has gone\nahead or dropped behind.\nBesides furnishing the farmer and his\nfamily a living, the increase or decrease\nin the net worth is what the farm has\ngiven in return for labor and the use of\ncapital. To be able to determine how\nmuch one has gained or lost during the\nyear is of great importance, and the\nvalue of the information alone will more\nthan repay the farmer for the time\nspent on the inventory. It is a common\nmistake for all those who do not take\nthe inventory to look at the amount of\navailable cash as a guage of their busi\nness success. This is a grievious mis\ntake for fluctuations in cash mean prac\ntically nothing. A gain of SI,OOO in cash\nat the end of the year may simply mean\nthat some of the property on hand last\nyear has been turned into cash. On the\nother hand, a decrease of 11,000 may\nmean that what was cash last year ap\npears now in the form of anew build\ning or some other improvement.\nAn annual inventory will also be of\nmaterial assistance in adjusting a loss\nby fire-should buildings, or contents,\nbe burned.\nTime of Taking Inventory.\nFor Wisconsin the time of taking an\ninventory will vary between January 1\nand April 1, preferably March 1. The\nexact date will depend on the location\nof the farm and the type of farming.\nOn a poultry farm the most convenient\ndate is in the fall; whereas on dairy and\nstock farms where there is likely to be\na great deal of feed on hand earlier in\nthe year it might be advisable to post\npone this work until later in the winter.\nFor best results ihe inventories ought\nto be taken on the same date each year,\nand, hence, it is advis: ble to choose a\ndate that is early enough to make it\npossible to get this work done before\nfield work begins even during the years\nof early spring.\nBuildings,\nList and give a valuation to each\nbuilding - The value to be put upon a\nbuilding will depend upon its present\nusefulness, original cost, character of\nbuilding material used, construction,\nstate of repair, age, location, etc. In\ncase of dwellings and barns, handiness\nand sanitation are also points which need\nto be considered. The value must be\nestimated on the basis of the above\nfactors. Statistics show that buildings\nwill, as a rule, decrease in value at a\nyearly rate of from two to four per cent\nof the original cost.\nWater System.\nUnder this heading enter all items\nthat have to do with the water supply\nof the farm and that is a part of real\nestate. Gasoline engines and movable\ntanks would not be included in this\ngroup. Pumps, welis, cement tanks\nand reservoirs, windmills, etc., should\nbe itemized and given separate values.\nThe values of windmills and pumps\nmust be reduced at the rate of from six\nto ten per cent yearly, whereas, wells,\nconcrete tanks and reservoirs can be\nput in the inventory at the same value\neach year.\nLand.\nAfter having obtained the value of\nbuildings and the water system, add the\ntwo totals together and subtract their\nCbe iUatmown meekly Header\nsum from the value of the whole farm.\nThe remainder will be the value of the\nland including fences, woodlots and\ndrainage. Land ought to be left at the\nsame value in the inventory from year\nto year unless there is good reason for\nsome other practice.\nLive Stock.\nHorses and cattle are inventoried in\ndividually. In order that they may be\nrecognized when taking the next in\nventory, they ought to be listed either\nby name or number. The local selling\nprice of horses and cows will help to\ndetermine their value. Age must be\nconsidered. Horses usually rise in\nvalue until the y are about 4 years old\nand then fluctuate with the seasonal\nprice until they are about 10, and then\ndrop off rather rapidly. The value of\nmilk cows will usually rise and fall in\nthe same manner. Hogs, sheep, poultry,\n(unless purebred), are usually inven\ntoried at a certain rate per head, this\nrate being based on market price.\nProduce and Supplies.\nThis includes, hay, straw, grains, corn,\nground feed, binder twine, paints, oils,\nnails, posts, etc. Most of the puchased\nsupplies are on hand in small quantities\nand can either be weighed or estimated.\nWith roughage, grains and corn it is\ndifferent. The amounts on hand of\nthese commodities are found by getting\nthe cubic contents of the bins, mows,\nand stacks. To find the approximate\nnumber of cubic feet in a stack, measure\nits length, width and “over.” To meas\nure the “over,” throw the tape over the\nstack and hold it tight down to the bot\ntom of the stack on both sides. Having\nthe measurement, multiply the length\nby the width, by the “over” and divide\nby 4 to get the number of cubic feet.\nThe number of cubic feet to a ton will\nvary from 320 to 550, depending on the\nkind of hay and how well it is packed.\n500 is ordinarily a safe figure to use.\nEar corn will run between 2y% and 2 l / 2\ncubic feet per bushel, depending some\nwhat on the size of the ears and the\nlength of time it has been in the crib.\nIf one wishes to use 2% cubic feet, the\neasiest method is to multiply by 4 and\ndivide by 10. A bushel of oats, barley,\netc., runs very close to 1 l / 2 cubic feet\nto the bushel. To reduce cubic feet to\nbushel, therefore, one may either divide\nby or else multiply the cubic con\ntents of the bin by 8 and divide by 10.\nSilage will vary from 20 to 60 po mds\nto the cubic foot, depending chiefly on\nthe height to which the silage stood in\nthe silo at the time of filling. There is\nno market price for silage, but for the\npurpose of the inventory it may be\nvalued at 1 3 the market price of hay.\nMachinery and Equipment.\nFor best results, list and value each\nmachine and tool by itself. If one does\nnot desire such detail, minor equipment\ncan be listed and valued in smaller\ngroups, as for instance, carpenter’s\ntools, b\'acksmith’s tools and garden\ntools. But no matter which method is\nused in inventorying minor equipment,\nit is always advisable at the time of tak\ning the first inventory to make a com\nplete list of all tools. For later inven\ntories the value of such equipment may\nbe determined by subtracting 10 per\ncent from the value of the preceding\ninventories and adding the value of new\ntools. At just what value to put ma\nchinery into an inventory will depend\non cost, age, usefulness and efficiency.\nA cinder that cuts 20 acres will last\nlonger than the one cutting 100 acres a\nyear. A machine stored indoors while\nnot used will last longer tnan the one\nleft outdoors, etc. The inventions of\nnew and more efficient machines may\ncause sudden drops in the values of the\nold machinery. As soon as the binder\nwas put on the market the value of the\nreaper was decreased rapidly. Special\ncrop machinery will decrease in value\nsuddenly in case the growing of that\ncrop is discontinued. An example of\nthis would be the sugar beet equipment\nin localities where the growing of beets\nhas been discontinued. The average\nrate at which machinery will decrease\nis not always of much use, but may\nserve as guides. The following are\nsome of the annual rates of deprecia\ntion for the more common machines:\nper cent.\nHay rakes, grain binders, mowers.. . 8\nDrills and seeders, corn planters, corn\ncultivators, gang plows. 7\nHay loaders, manure spreaders 12\nWalking plows and heavy harness... 6\nHarrows 9\nWagons and disks 5\nCash and Notes.\nCash on hand aud in the bank, as well\nas all notes and bills that the farm busi\nness has coming from others, should be\ndetermined aud inventoried accurately.\nBy depositing in a bank proceeds of all\nproduce aud stock sold, and payment of\nall bills bv bank cheek, the annual “pro\nfit or loss” may be more easily ascertain\ned aud annual inventories more readily\nprepared.\nDebts.\nAll debts should be included in the in\nventory. It is advisable to list each\nmortgage ana note and bill separately,\nand to give the name of the party to\nwhom it is drawn.\nValuation.\nThe chief aim in taking an inventory\nshould be to make it show the actual con-\nditions of the farm business. In order\nto make the inventory show this it is\nnecessary to be conservative in all valua\ntions. To be able to place an exact\nvalue on the different items of farm\nproperty is, of course, difficult, but for\ntunately this is not absolutely necessary\nfor the accuracy of the inventory as a\nwhole will not vary directly with the\ncorrectness of the valuation of any one\nitem. If one acquaints himself with\ncurrent prices and tries to be fair in\nhis estimate he is not likely to be very\nfar off on the value of any one item,\nand what mistakes he may make wil\nmost likely offset one another. In case\nof the herd he may rate some of his cows\na little high, but he is just as apt to\nvalue other cows a little too low, and\nthe chances are that by adding together\nall of the values his result would be very\nclose to what the herd would sell for.\nK.

WIS„ JANUARY 23. 1914-\nCITY ATTORNEY\nREPORTS SUITS\nStales Outcome ci Boughner and\nLewis Fund Cases at\nCouncil Meeting\nThe following report was given at a\nregular meeting of the city council by\nCity Attorney Gustav Buchheit:\nTo the Common Council of the City of\nWatertown, Wis.\nGentlemen: It is ray duty to report to\nyou at this time the outcome of the two\nof our most important lawsuits, namel>:\nthe one relating to the Fannie P. Lewis\nPark Fund and the case of Helen C.\nBoughner, against the city. The former\ncase involved purely questions of law,\nand Judge Grimm has seen fit to decide\nagainst the contention of the city. In\nthe Boughner case the jury, in Judge\nLueck’s court, rendered a special verdict,\nwhich evidently was based on nothing\nbut sympathy for the plaintiff, who it\nappears is crippled and in destitute cir\ncumstances. I fail to find any evidence\nto establish the alleged fact that the ice\nand snow upon which the plaintiff fell,\nexisted for three weeks prior to the ac\ncident, which under the law must be\naffirmatively shown by the plaintiff be\nfore she can recover. Consequently it is\nmy advice that both of these cases be\ntaken to our supreme court, in justice\nto the taxpayers. Both cses present\nnew questions and the secondary liabil\nity, if there is any, of the Barker Lumber\nand Fuel company can be ascertained in\nno other way, having reference, of course,\nonly to the Boughner case. The additional\ncosts in both these cases, if the city lost\nin the supremo court, would be about\none hundred dollars. Besides the afore\nsaid .castes the cases of Mrs. Schroeder,\nMrs. Polzin and the midnight tresspass\ners may come on for trial next month,\nand in order to provide for the advance\nwitness fees, etc., which may be required\nin such event, and to provide for the\nsupreme court’s clerk fees, in the above\ncases, which I shall appeal, I hereby ask\nyou to appropriate the sum of $75.00.\nRespectfully yours,\nGustav Buchheit,\nCity Attorney.\nStale Feeble Minded Home\nQuito a number of merchants are in\nterested in the fact that the State may\nbuild a home for the feeble minded here,\nnorthwest of the city limits.

It is an actual and\nstupendous condition that faces, aud\nthreatens to outface, the small town and\nthe countryside. A recent report of our\nResearch Bureau establishes that the\nmail order houses carry on annually\ntwenty per cent, as much business as\nthat done by the country merchants of\nthe nation. In other words for every\ndollar spent by the rural consuming\npublic, the town or community, or sec\ntion is taxed twenty cejits. It is virtu\nally a tax on the general resources, since\nthe endless chain element is missing.\nNot a cent of .his money comes back to\nthe spender or to any other member of\nthe community, as does a goodly share\nof all the money spent with the local\ndealer. It is aa economic fact that every\nmail order purchase by a citizen marks\na blow at the prosperity of the com\nmunity.”\nOne feature of the League’s education\nal campaign, according to the statement,\nwill be a through presentation of figures\naiming to show that “mail order bargains\nare, in very many cases, such in name\nonly.” On this point, Mr. Whittier says:\n“Aside from the social phase is the con\nstantly increasing evidence that the con\nsumer, in perhaps a majority of cases,\ncan trade at home and actually save\nmoney on the yeai’s purchases.’’\nBEE-KEEPERS\'\nCONVENTION\nWill Be Held At Madison Tuesday\nand Wednesday.

Grace\nand Intelligence, and Especially\nRadiance.\nWhat can a young girl, who Is net\nther a great beauty nor a great heir\ness, nor one to whom the gods stood\nsponsor at birth, do to make herself\npopular?\nLet us sit down and take our chins\nIn our hands and think about It\nA girl must have, at least In some\nsmall degree, four qualities. There\nare children of fortune who have them\nall, and in abundance, but as from a\nsmall palette of primary colors a great\npicture may be painted, just so out\nof a few elementary attributes quite\nwonderful results are possible. The\nfour qualities of personality are:\nBeauty, grace, intelligence, radk\nance.\nBeauty may be that of face or fig\nure, oAAt may be merely an effort of\nbeauty through style, charm, or even\none of the other three qualities fol\nlowing:\nGrace includes not alone symmetrj\nof movement, but all accomplish\nments In activity, such a a dancing,\nskating, swimming, riding, and also\nany especial gifts, such as a talent for\nmusic or acting. In other words, the\ngirl who has the "gift of grace” in the\ngirl who does things well.\nBy intelligence is meant the sympa\nthetic, adaptable quality of mind, rath\ner than that of the brilliant order. Hut\nthe one great attribute that crowns\nthem all —granting, of course, some\ngift of the other three—but without\nwhich beauty, grace, cleverness are\nall as applet of Sodom—is the sense\nof enjoyment, the gift of happiness.\n1 dot t think 1 can better define it\nthan by tbe word radiance. And best\nof all, radiance is a quality that can\nb( cultivated.\nBeards in Olden Times.\nThe Greeks wore their beards until\nthe time of Alexander, but that great\ngeneral, probably remembering an en\ncounter with bis wife, orderd the Mace\ndonians to be shaved, lest their beards\nshould g_lve a handle to their enemies.\nHeards were worn by the Romans In\n390 I), C.

In\nthe same action in which he lost bis\neyesight, he had a father and three\nbrothers killed leaving out of a whole\nfamily only himself and his aged moth\ner.\nAfter Them. —General Grant has\ncaptured, within the past seven months,\nfour hundred and twelve cannons,\nnamely: fifty-two on his advance to\nVicksburg, three hundred at that place\nand sixty last week before Chattanoo\nga. Two thousand United Stales can\nnons were stolen from Norfolk at the\nbeginning of the rebellion, but if Grant\nkeeps on at this : ate he will soon get\nthem all back again.

A couple\nof weeks ago the three started out in the\ncountry for a longer walk than usual.\nThey took the railroad track until they\nhad gone as far as they wished and\nthen made for a country mail on which\nthey proposed home. ’ After\ntramping an hour they thought they\nshould be in sight of the city but could\ndiscover no trace of Manitowoc. They\nipuckened their pace for an other half\nhour and still could discover no trace\nof the lost city. Peers thought some\none had run away with the pjace; Sas\nse thought there was some witchcraft\nabout the thing and Levereni’. proposed\nthey camp out and wait for a relief ex\npedition. A farmer passed by and the\nthree hailed him with. "Say, where’s\nManitowoc’?” The farmer thought\nthey were guying him and wanted to\nlight the crowd. Hasse thought it\nwould be a good plan to mount\nand holler as they used to do In olden\ntime w hen lost in the woods in hope\nthat someone in the city would hear\nand give an answering shout. Their\nqueer maneuvers made the farmers\nsuspicious and when one of the crowd\nwould approach a house to inquire\nabout Manitowoc, lie would he chased\nout of the yard with dogs. Peers went\ninto the woods having heard at one\ntime that persons lost could find ttieir\nway homo by noticing on which side of\nthe tree the moss grew. Put it was as\nhard to find moss as it was to lind the\ncity. In the meantime the farmers\nwere collecting with pitchforks, hoes\nand axes to drive away the three dan\ngerous looking characters who pre\ntended they did not know the way to\nManitowoc. The trio set olf on a run\nand took anew road. They reached\nthe Pranch village by nightfall but\ndidn’t know the place. One of them\ninsisted it was Amigo and that there\nwere a few people there who know\nhim. Another thought it was Hurley\nas they walked far enough to reach\nthat place. The third thought it was\nDepere and pointed to the river as\nproof. They came near having a row\nover the matter but in the nick of\nlime a man approached whom they\nknew. Py round about questions they\nlesrned where they were and hired a\nman to lake them home.\nNow when they go outside the city\nlimits for a walk one of ’em walks\nbackwards so as to keep the city from\ngetting awry from them. People who\nmeet them wonder why one fellow pre\nfers to walk backward, but the oilier\ni wo explain that he wras born that way.\nThey take turns in this task and never\nget beyond sight of the city.\nEDUCATIONAL.\n(ByC.

Most of these young people have\ncompleted the work of the elementary\nschools. The schools are located in\nthecountry and are intended primarl\'y\nfor country youth. The sciences con\nnected with agriculture are taught,\nbut the greatest emphasis is laid on\nhistory, biography, and literature.\nThe schools then are not vocational\nschools except in a very broad sense.\nThe great object is to awaken the\nintellectual life of the students, lo\nmake them ambitious to live efficient\nly and nobly, and to teach them how\nthis may be accomplished.\nIt is said that 10 per cent of the pop\nulation of Denmark goes through these\nschools. Their popularity is attested\nby the fact that they are supported by\ncooperative effort of the people them\nselves; only very small annual grants\nare received from the government.\n’[’he Folk High Schools are a mighty\nagency :n the life not only of the rural\ncommunities hut of the nation at large.\nFive members of the Denmark cabinet\narc from the Folk High Schools, four\nof these are farmers. Many members\nof the lower house of parliament are\nalso from these schools.

Early in th\'c\nday Matzi was arrested on a charge of\npetty larceny made by William Schnei\nder, a contractor, and after he had se\ncured an adjournment of this hearing\nuntil next Tuesday, Matzi himself be\ncame a plaintiff and isecured a civil\nwarrant for the arrest of William F.\nHoward and Essie O. Reading, two well\nknown contrac ors. He charged them\nwith tresspass alleging that the cor trac\ntors had entered a house on the west\nside after Matzi had taken possession\nof it under a contract to secure a land\ncontract. The land contract had not\nbeen drawn, but M.atzi alleged that he\nwas in possession of the premises.\nHoward and Reading declared that they\nhad entered the place as contractors to\nfinish up work which had been con\ntracted for before Matzi took posses\nsion They declared that they had the\n-perrtrtfsioh of Matzi and his wife to\nenter the premises.

R. B. Way, vice president\nand manager of the electrical depart\nment of the company has been busy\nworking out the proposition for several\nweeks and he will come to Kenosha on\nMonday ready to submit his figures.\nNo indication as to the amount to be\nasked for the lights has been allowed\nto creep out of the offices of the com\npany and the proposition will be a\ncomplete surprise to the members of\nthe council. The company has made a\nformal petition to the mayor asking\nthat the hours for lighting in Kenosha\nbe changed. The suggestion is that the\nlights be started eight minutes earlier\nin the eveniug and turned off eight min\nutes earlier in the morning. This will\nmake the schedule in Kenosha conform,\nwith tne\'s* 1 nodule now in use in other\ncities in the state. It is probable that\nthe council will give its sanction to the\nchange in the schedule.\nMARRIED AT FOND DU LAC.\nMiss Grace Morris Becomes Bride of\nTheodore Hettrick Today.\nA wedding of great interest to many\nKenosha people was celebrated at St.\nJoseph church at Fond du Lac this\nmorning w\'hen Miss Grace Morris,\ndaughter of Mr. and Mrs. C.

The machine room will be\none story, 85x120 feet, and adjoining it\nwill be four new dry kilns. These kilns\nwill be each 18x120 feet in size. The\ncompany installed its present kilns\nseven years ago but the system now in\nuse has become antiquated and the\nplans for the coming year provide for\nthe installation of the latest kilns of\nthe Morton company. These, when com\npleted, will give the. company a capac\nity of 40,000 feet of dry lumber daily.\nThe next building will be a new power\nplant and this plant will provide for a\nchange from steam to electric power.\nIt is the plan cf the company to change\nover the pqwer of the entire plant as\nrapidly as possible and electric units of\nthe most modern kind will be installed.\nAnother building is a glue room which\nwill be used for veneering. This build\ning will be two stories in height and\n60x220 feet. With this space the busi\nness of the company may be greatly\nenlarged. The last building in the new\nplans is a great storage warehouse two\nstories in height and 60x122 feet in\nsize.\n“We are planning to double the ca\npacity of the plant,” said L. T. Han\nnahs m discussing the plans of the\ncompany this morning. “We appre\nciate that this building work will take\nsome time but we expect to rush the\noperations as much as possible. Growth\nof the business along many lines has\nmade necessary these big additions to\nthe plant. We desire to take care of\nthe business in the best possible man\nner and in order to keep abreast of the\ngrowing business a very large increase\nin capacity has been demanded.”\nThe Hannahs company has been\ngrowing by leaps and bounds in the\npast few years and the plant is now\none of the largest of the kind in the\ncountry.

It has been a year of joy and\nsorrow in Kenosha and it has brought\nits blessings and its pains. The year\nhas not been a notable one along any\nlines and there have been few great\nevents to make it stand out prominent\nly in the history of the city. Regarded\nas a hoo-doo year from the start peo\nple have dreaded the coming of calami\nties, yet few years have found less as\ncidents in Kenosha. There have, of\ncourse, been shadows in many hearts,\nbut these have been counterbalanced\nby joys in the hearts of others. The\ndeath rate in Kenosha during the year\nhas been a normal one. The city has\nbeen free from any serious scourge of\ncontagious disease, this being in\nstrange contrast to the preceding year.\nThere has been an unusually large\namount of crime in the city during the\ntwelve months and the courts have been\ncorrespondingly busy.\nIn the affairs of the municipality the\nyear has been one of many accomplish\nments. There has been large extensions\nof the paving and sewer systems of the\ncity. Much has been done along lines\nof systematizing the affairs of the var\nious departments and commissions un\nder city rule. The old trunk sewer\nclaim bogey laid over to 1913 by the\nformer year has been dispose! of in a\nmanner favorable to the city and fair\nto the contractors. Ashland avenue has\nbeen opened. The city has had much\ntrouble during the year in seeking to\nsecure better service from public utili\nty corporations but with the closing\nof the year it appears that most of\nthese problems have been satisfactorily\nmet. The new north side trunk sewer\nhas been started and is nearing comple\ntion, plans are under way to secure\nfiltration for the city water. The big\ngest problem that is being left over to\nthe new year is the problem of ar\nranging the tracks of the North-\nWestern Railway Company aud the\nproblem of securing the entrance of the\ninterurban cars to the heart of the\ncity. This problem was solved early\nin .1913, but the solution was found to\nbe an incomplete one.\nFinancially, the year has been a bet\nter one for the city than the preceding\none and, while taxes are higher than in\n1912, this was made necessary by the\ngreat increase in the state taxes.\nThe Industrial Year,\nAmong the industries of Kenosha\n1913 was a freak year. Up to the first\nof November it\' gave promise of prov\ning a record breaking year so the man\nufacturers, but the last two months of\nthe year have brought a slump. This\nis declared to be only temporary and\nmanufacturers agree that the opening\nof the new year will see nearly all the\nworkmen of Kenosha back in their old\npositions. No new industries of any\ngreat size have been established in the\ncity but a number of small plants have\nbeen opened and these promise to grow\ninto much greater industries before the\nend of another year. Many of the lo\ncal plants have made large additions\nduring the year and the number of em\nployed men and women in the city lias\nbeen increased.\nSchools Broaden Out.\nOne of the notable developments of\nthe year just closing was the broaden\ning out of the w\'ork of the publie\nschool system. Kenosha has done much\ntoward extending practical education\nfor its working classes and the city is\ndeclared to be a model for other cities\nin the state. Coupled with these move\nments have been movements for larger\nand better schools and for the build\ning of the new high school. The play\nground movement has been one of the\nreal live questions in Kenosha during\nthe year and plans which have matured\npromise to offer an early solution for\nthis problem in Kenosha.\nActive work has been done during\nthe year toward the extension of the\npark system of the city. This is cer\ntain to bear fruit within another year.\nNotable among the year’s accomplish\nments in the city was the completion\nof the wall about the Kenosha ceme\ntery. This is regarded as one of the\nOldest Paper\nIn\nThe Northwest\nNUMBER 36\nmost beautiful and substantial pieces\nof work ever done in Wisconsin.\nKenosha has added quo new church\nduring the year, the St. Anthony\'s\nchurch having been opened only a few\nmonths ago.\nThe most notable events of the year,\narranged in chronological order, fol\nlow:\nJanuary.\n3.

Towers, A. 8., J. of the\nMichigan Bar.\nWho Owns the Air?\n“Free as air” is ard\nso long as man had not succeeded in\nmastering the air this was true\nenough. There was air sufficient\nfor f I of us and as none could nay\nigate it with any success, questions\nof the control of the air did not\narise.\nBut now we the aeroplane\nand the airship and we are ; n what\npromises to be the beginning of an\nage of aviation. So it is that the\nlaw is beginning to develop: to keep\npace with the development of aero\nnautics. As yet flying machines are\nfew in number, but it seems that\nwe may well look forward to a time\nin the not far distant future when\nthe passage of aeroplanes and air\nships above us will be no uncom\nmon spectacle. What right has the\naeronaut to pass above our proper\nty? What are his liabilities in case\nhe causes injuries to those below\nhim? These and many similar\nquestions are arising, and the law\nis preparing to answer them as\nthey arise.\nIf one passes over your land, on\nthe surface, without your permis\nsion, be has committed a tresspass\nand though he may have caused no\nappreciable damage to your prem\nises, you may recover small dama\nges in a court of law by way of vin\ndication of your rights. What are\nyour rights against the aeronaut\nwho passes through the air above\nyour property? It is a fundamental\nrule of English law that a person’s\nproperty extends indefinitely down\nward and indefinitely upward. This\nrule has existed since the beginn\nings of law, and qnder it one has\ncontrol of the area above his land.\nA strict observance of this rule\nwould lead to this result: An aero\nnaut who passes above your land is\na technical trespasser, and though\nhe drops nothing upon you or yours,\nthough he cause you no real injury,\nhe has violated your rights —he has\ntrespassed—and you may sue him\nand recover damages. Such would\nbe the logical result of the applica\ntion of the law as it has long exist\ned in English-speaking countries.\nBut it seems highly improbable\nthat the law will be allowed to re\nmain in this condition. Aviation\nhas come to stay and it would seem\nto be a necessity that aeronauts be\nallowed to pass freely over the\nproperty beneath, whether it be pri\nvately owned or a public highway.\nThis necessity seems certain to\ncause a change in the law, which is\nlikely to come in the form of legis\nlative enactments concerning flying\nmachines. The French have already\ntaken action, a law having been re\ncently enacted which extends to\naeronauts free right to navigate the\nair, passing where they will. The\nnation retains the general control\nof the air, however, so that it may\nprevent any but French airships\nfrom flying over French territory,\nand make such regulations as may\nbe necessary.\nAmong the American states Con\nnecticut has taken the lead in pas\nsing legislation of this character.\nA law entitled “An Act Concerning\nthe Registration, Numbering, and\nUse of Air Ships, and the Licensing\nof Operators Thereof” was passed\nby that state in 1911. Under this\nlaw airships are subject to rules\nsimilar to those generally applied\nto automobiles. The owner must\nfile certain information with the\nSec. of State, pay a fee, receive a\ncertificate entitling him to fly, and\na number. This number must be\ndisplayed on the airship in letters\nnot less than three feet in height.\nAirships may be operated only by\nlicensed aeronauts.\nThis law fixes the responsibility\nfor all resulting damages in the fol-\nWE WISH YOU ALL A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR.\nThe River Falls Journal\nlowing section:\n“Every aeronaut shall be respon\nsible f>r all damages suffered in\nthis state by any >- son from injuries\ncaused by any voyage in an airship\ndirected by such aeronaut; aud if\nhe be the agent or employee of an\nother in making such voyage his\nprincipal or employer shall be re\nsponsible for such damage.”\nThe states of Massachusetts and\nNew York are considering similar\nlegislation and before many years\nit seems probable that every state\nwill have acted on this subject.\nThe question of fixing the respon\nsibility for damages, which b«s\nb ;en cared for in the Connecticut\nact, is one that is likely to be of\nimmediate importance. The dan\ngers of airships passing over prop\nerty are considerable. Parts, bag\ngage, or ballast might be dropped,\ncausing injury to persons or pro\nperty beneath. The fall of an aero\nplane upon a city might occasion\nsevere damage to those on land, as\nwell as to the unfortunate aeronaut\nBut fancy the damage resulting\nfrom the collision between two\ngiant airships of the Zepplin type\nWith the present interest in avia\ntion and the popular encourage\nment which it is receiving, the atti\ntude of the lawmakers is likely to\nbe favorable to them as far as\ngranting to them the right to freely\nuse the air is concerned Landown\ners are not likely to endeavor to de\nmand a fee from aeronauts passing\nover their property. The legisla\ntors are likely to grant great free\ndom of passage and the courts are\nlikely to sustain the legislation. Of\ncourse, a property owner might ob\nject that when the legislature grants\nthe right to navigate the air freely\nit gives a right to pass over his\nland and thus takes away from him\na portion of his property. Such a\ncontention, if made, will raise some\ninteresting cases, the result of\nwhich no one can foresee.\nBut as to fixing the responsibility\nfor injury resulting from the opera\ntion of airships, the law seems in\ndined to hold the aeronaut to strict\naccount. If the aeronaut wishes to\ntake the risk of riding in the air, he\nmust further take all the risk of\ncausing injury to persons or prop\nerty over which he passes. As mat\nters stand now, even in the absence\nof a statute fixing the responsibili\nties, as in Connecticut, a person in\njured by an airship may almost cer\ntainly recover damages from the\naeronaut. If a passing airship lets\ntall any object which injures your\nproperty you may sue the person\nwho is responsible for the operation\nof the airship.\nA few cases have already arisen\nin England. A British aeronaut\nwas driving his aeroplane and at\ntempted to descend into a field. The\nfield was occupied by a cow and the\ncow apparently resented the appear\nance of this strange object from\nabove. As the aeroplane descended\nthe cow rushed toward it, making\nhostile demonstrations. The aero\nnaut endeavored to avoid the infur\niated bovine, but was unsuccessfull\nand her cowship succeeded in plung\ning beneath the machine just as it\nreached the earth. The resu.ts\nwere disasterous to the cow, and\nthe sequel came when the farmer\nwho owned the cow sued the aero\nnaut and recovered damages for\nthe loss of the cow.\nThe aeroplane has found its way\ninto the classified ad columns as\nwell as into the courts, as witness\nhe following interesting ad which\nappeared in a German newspaper:\n“Lost from an aeroplane, a gold\nwatch and chain. Last seen disap\npearing in large stack of rye on a\nfield near Ulzen.”\n(Copyright, 1913, by Walter K.

The President’s band\nwas stationed near the main steps.\nOn the lower steps were a thousand\nsingers who contributed their ser\nvices, while above and in front nl\nstatuary on either side of the en\ntrance were the wise men from the\nEast, angels with outstretched\nwings, Babe in the Manger and oth\ner figures in a series of tableaux.\nOut on the p.aza a few yards dis\ntant stood a huge Norway pine,\ncovered with thousands of incan\ndescent lights, with a brilliant elec\ntric star glistening from the top\nmost branch. Calcium lights thrown\nupon the figures added to the beau\nty of the occasion so that betw en\nmusic, lights and tableaux, it all\nemed a veritable faryland\nFrom where I was standing on\nthe steps, the spectacle was inspir\ning and it occurred to me that al\nthough every Preside t from Wash\nington and Lincoln down to Wilson\nhad looked cut from the same p irr\nand across the same plaza, none had\nwitnessed a more beautiful or im\npressive scene. No presents were\niven, no was slighted and do\nneart burnings followed Everybody\nwas welcome and the last remem\nbrance of the occasion was had\nfrom a mammoth electric sign\nreaching a hundred feet above and\nacross the main entrance of the\nCapitol, bearing the message to\n\'ens of thousuads, “Peace on Earth,\nGood Will to Men.”\nSenator LaFollette’s seaman’s\nnill has brought forth many protests\ntrom the shipping interests along\nlake Michigan.

One of th\nminagers of a line of lake vesse s\nwas heard to say he would not risk\nhis family on a nignt trip across\nthe lakes, because of the possibility\nof fire or other accident and con\nsequent loss of life. Under present\nconditions life boats are not pro\nvided for one-tenth of the passen\ngers on the average vessel, which\nillustrates the good judgment of\nthis manager in his desire to pro\ntect his own people from danger.\nLaFollette’s bill extends full pro\ntection to every passenger whether\nriding on the lake or ocean, or in a\nluxurious first cabin or down in the\nsteerage.\nCongressman Hayes of California\nis the senior member of the Re\npublican minority of the Banking\nCommittee that handled the cur\nrency bill.

WIS., JANUARY 2. 1914-\nMeal Inspection\nThe United Stales government pro\nvides for inspection of all meat picking\nplants which are engaged in interstate\nand foreign commerce. The, methods\nemployed in large plants are exceedingly\ninteresting. First, an inspection is made\nof all live animals and "suspects” arc\nculled for especially careful observation\nand regulated handling. After slaugh\nter, each nrocess in the further prepara\ntion of the carcass for the market, is\ncarefully watched The inspectors be\ncome highly skilled in the detection of\nevidences of diseased tissue which passes\nunder their eyes and hands.\nAs in the case of the first live Inspec\ntion upon the first suspicion of disease,\nan indelible brand sir-pends further prep\naration of the meat. The carcass is then\nshipped to a special examining room for\nfurther study and final disposition. By\nthis means, to reach the consumer the\nbody of a diseased animal would have to\npass the marvelously keen observation of\na number of highly skilled inspectors.\nThe diseases most often found are\ntuberculosis and actinomycosis in cattle;\ntuberculosis, hog cholera and various\nblood and organic diseases in swine.\nSome states have provided for inspec\ntion of abattoirs not under federal juris\ndiction. Wisconsin has made no such\nprovision. Dealers are sometimes sus\npected of offering for sale to inspected\npacking houses, only those animals which\nare presumably healthy. If this be so,\nmeat from uninspected slaughter houses\nis apt to be considerably below the nor\nmal average as concerns freedom from\ndisease.\nIn addition to the detection of diseased\nmeat, the inspectors maintain a close\nsnr yell lance over the general cleanliness\nof the plant. If the packers ever resent\ned the rigid demands of the government,\nno such resentment is now manifest.\nUndoubtedly, they recognize the govern\nment stamp of approval to he of distinct\ncommercial value.\nWonderful Cough Remedy\nDr. King’s New Discovery is known\neverywhere as the remedy which will\nsuwily stop a cough or*culd.

NUMBER 21\nPREVENTION FOR\nWHITE PLAGUE\nMedical Authority Tolls How To\nPrevent and Advises Patients\nShowing Symptoms\n“Tuberculosis has many characteristics\niji common with those of noxious weeds."\nI pon this theory the Wisconsin Anti-\nTuberculosis association has formulated\nits programme, according to Dr. 11. K.\nDoarholt of Milwaukee, director of the\nhealth bureau of the University of Wis\nconsin Extension division, and secretary\nof the organization.\n‘‘The must certain means of prevent\ning the spread of a weed pest is to gather\ncarefully and burn the seed," continued\nDoctor Dowrholt. Likewise, the most\ncertain way of preventing the spread of\nconsumption is to burn the seed.\n“Germs of consuption are contained in\nthe expectorations of patients suffering\nfrom the disease. Therefore if all ex\npectorations were carefully gathered\nin special cups, napkins and papers\nand burned before any of the seed\nwore scattered, tuberculosis would\nbecome historical. Karly knowledge at\nthe stage when the disease is most easily\ncured requires skillful diagnosis and\npatients should consult a skillful physi\ncian on first suspicion of infection, in\ndividuals who have been subjected to\nprolonged contact should have periodic\nexaminations extending over a number\nof years.\n“Providing sanitarium cure for ad\nvanced consumptives in a great measure\ncuts off the sources of infection. But a\nsufllcient number of sanatorium beds\nCan not be secured In a month or a year.\nAnd some patients may never consent to\ngo to a sanatorium. lienee we must pro\nvide as good protection as is possible\nfrom consumptives in the home. We can\naccomplish this by the visiting nurse\nand a wider knowledge of the funda\nmental facts in connection with the\nnature, cure, and prevention of the\ndisease."\nHog Cholera Don’ts\nThe following precautions are recom\nmended for keeping hog cholera from\nan uninfected drove by H T. Galloway,\nAsst. Sec. of Agriculture.\n1. Do not locate hog lots near a pul lie\nhighway, a railroad or n stream. The\ngerm of hog cholera may bo carried along\nany one of these avenues.\n2. Do not allow strangers or neighbors\nto enter your hog lots, and do not go in\nto your neighbors’ lots. If Is is absolute\nly necessary to pass from one hog lot in\nto another, lirst clean your shoes care\nfully and then wash them with a 21 per\ncent solution of the compound solution\nof crosol (U. S. P.)\n3. Do not put now slock, either hogs\nor cuttle, in lots with a herd already on\nthe farm. Newly purchased hogs should\nbe put in separate enclosures well sepa\nrated from the herd on the farm and\nkept under observation for three weeks,\nbecause practically all stock cars, un\nloading chutes, and pens are infected\nwith hog cholera, and hogs shipped by\nrail are therefore apt to contract hog\ncholera.\n4. Hogs sent to fairs should be quar\nantined for at least three weeks after\nthey return to the farm.\n5. If hog cholera breaks out on a\nfarm, separate the sick from the appar\nently healthy animals, and burn all car\ncasses of death. Do not leave* them mi\nburned, or this will endanger all other\nfarmers in the neighborhood.\n<5. If after the observance of all possi\nble precautions hog cholera appears on\nyour farm, notify the State veterinarian,\nor State Agricultural college, and secure\nserum for the treatment of those not\naffected. The early application of tills\nserum Is essential.\nSome of these precautions may seem\nunnecessary and troublesome, but they\ndo not cost much, and they are very\nvaluable preventive measures.\nThe Tax Kate\nThe tax rate in this city for the cur\nrent year is $16,00 per $1,0)0 in the Jef\nferson county wards and $18.13 in the\nDodge county wards* If the assesnirnt\nIs 90 per cent of the actual value, the\nrate is excessive: if the asnessed valua\ntion is moderate then the rate Is reason\nable —on the whole however Watertown\nhas no cause for complaint, below we\ngive the tax rate per 11,000 in some of\nthe other cities of the state:\nAn tigo $29.00, Bar a boo $23, 01, Beaver\nDarn s23.2o, Hoscobel S2B 00, Beloit $17.4b,\nBurlington $24,07, Edgerton 118.94, Kan\nClaire $23.50, Jefferson SIB.BO, Madison\n$16.50, Monroe $17.00, Oshkosh sl7 50,\nPltttteville 117.23, Portage $20.00, Janes\nville $15.00, Milwaukee 118.00, La Crosse\n$25,00, Richland Center $29.40, Toinah\n$20.12, Btonghton $18.70, Whitewater\n$25.90, W aterloo $17.94, Waukesha $19.50,\nLake Geneva $23.81,\nAn Ideal Woman’s Laxative\nWho wants to take salts, or castor oil,\nwhen there is nothing better than Dr.\nKing’s New Life Pills for all bowel\ntroubles.

Staaten im Jahre\n1913. trotz der Dürre und anderer hin\ndernden Umstände. Nach dem am\nMontag vom Ackerbaudcpartement in\nWashington veröffentlichten Bericht mar\ndas Jahr das erfolgreichste in der Ge\nschichte des Landes. Genau betragt der\nWerth der Ernte 6,100.000,000, wo\nvon K 3,650,000,000 aus Vieh entfallen.\nDer Werth ist doppelt so groß wie der\njenige der Ernte vom Jahre 1800; um\nmehr als eine Milliarde größer als im\nJahre 1009 und bedeutend größer als\nin 1912. Von der Gesanimlernle wird\nschätzungsweise 52 und von dem Vieh\n20 Prozent aus den Farmen selbst ver\nbleiben, sodaß das Bareinkommen der\nFarmer 55.847,000,000 beträgt.\nTrotzdem das Jahr 1913 ein Regen,\njähr war. und trotzdem die Zahl der\'\nFarmen sich seit 1910 um 11 Prozent\naus etwa 6,600,000 erbotn hat, ist nach\nAnsicht des AckerbaudevarlemenlS nicht\nzu erwarten, daß der Preis der Lebens\nmittel heruntergeht.

Es handelt sich hierbei um eine\nmöglichst g-nmue Karte der Randge\nbirge des Mondes, die zur genauen\nBahnbestimmung des Mondes von\neinschneidender Bedeutung ist und\nneues Marerial zur Theorie der\nMondbewcaung beibringt. Sonne\nund Planeten erscheinen nämlich, we\ngen ihrer größeren Entfernung, als\nKreise oder Ellipsen, und so ist ihre\ngenaue Ortsbestimmung nicht beson\nders schwierig; der Mond dagegen\nerscheint nicht kreis- oder ellipsen\nförmig begrenzt, und daher ließ sich\nbisher sein Mittelpunkt oder Schwer\nPunkt nickt genau genug bestimmen.\nMan sucht: bisher diesem Uebelstande\ndurch E\'i\'füvrung eines „Fixpunttes"\nabzuhelfen, dessen selenographEche\nKoordinaten bestimmt wurden. Hayn\nbat nun den aussichtsreicheren Weg\neingeschlagen, den Mondmittelvunft\nbesser zu definieren und dazu eine\nmöglichst genaue Karte des Mond\nrandes anzustellen und alle Beobach\ntungen aus möglichst viele Punkte des\nUmfanges -u bestehen.\nEs stur cm Ganzen 200 Mond\nbitder hnaestellt und 10,000 Punkte\nmit ihren\' skleno-graphischen Koordi\nnaten festgelegt.

Und so ist es denn\nauch wohl als ein Akt ausgleichen\nder Gerechtigkeit aufzufassen, daß die\nLebewesen, die, statt sich wie die an\ndern auf ehrliche Weise durchs Le\nben zu schlagen, die bequemeren Da\nseinsbedingungen des Schmarotzer\ntums auszunutzen gelernt haben und\nvon den mühsam erworbenen Körper\nsästen anderer Wesen sich mäste,\nauch ihrerseits wieder, wenn auch\nwiderwillig, als Wirte aufzutreten\ngezwungen werden.\nDie Naturgeschichte kennt eine\nganze Reihe solcher Schmarotzer in\nSchmarotzern: zu ihnen gehört nach\nden Forschungen des Franzosen rw\nweran auch der Floh, der lustige\nSpringer, dem bekanntlich die größ\nte Kälte nichts anhaben kann. Der\nFamilie der Flöhe ist überhaupt in\nden letzten Jahren von der Forschung\nein außerordentliches Interesse ent\ngegengebracht worden, da man ver\nschiedene ihrer Angelürigen in dem\nbegründeten Verdacht hatte, daß sie\nbei der Uelertragung vcn allerlei an\nsteckenden Krankheiten ein? nicht ein\nwandfreie Nolle spielten. Auch der\nParasit, den Laweran im Hundefloh\nauffand, kann auf andere Tiere über\ntragen werden. Er stellt ein mi\nkroskopisch kleines Schräubchen vor,\ndas sich vom Darminhalt nährt, sich\nin ihni bewegt und entwickelt.

So gaben zu\nAnfang des Krieges verschiedene der\nägäischen Inseln besondere Briefmar\nker, heraus, z. B. Jkanen, Mytilenr,\nSamos und Lemnos. Griechenland\nversah die in den eroberten Gebieten\nverwendeten Marken mit einem be\nsonderen Ueberdruck, und neuerdings\nhat auch der werdende Staat Alba\nnien sich schon mit der Herausgabe\nvon eigenen Briefmarken befaßt. Zu\nerst verwendete man dort türkisch\nMarken, die mit einem höchst primi\ntiven albanischen Adler überdruckt\n\'Wurden. In der letzten Zeit aber hat\nman\'einen regelw-chten Stempel ange\nfertigt, welcher die Inschrift trägt\n„Postat c Qeverrics se Perlohefhme":\ndiese Marke wurde in den Werten zu\n2E Para und l Piaster herausgege\nben, d. h. die Postbeamten stellen sie\nselbst her. indem sie diesen Stempel\nauf ein Stück Papier drucken und auf\nden ihnen übergebenen Brief Neben.\nGriechenland hat den Briefmarken\nsammlern im legten Stadium noch\neine ganze Reihe bon provisorischen\nMarken beschert, die zu den seltensten\ngehören, welche seit Ansang dieses\nJahrhundcris überhaupt ausgegeben\nwurden. So hatten die Bulgaren in\nder für einige Zeit besetzten Hafen\nstadt Kawalla iyr eigenen Marlen\neingeführt. AIS die Griechen diesen\nOrt einnahmen, fanden sie einen klei\nne Nest dieser Marken vor und ver\nsahen sie schnell mit einem griechischen\nAusdruck. Von einzelnen dieser Pi"\nvisoricn sind nur 10 Stück hergestellt,\nwodurch sich ihre Seltenheit erklärt.\nAls die griechische Floite vor Dedca\ngatsch lag, wurden auf ihren Schiffen\nBriefe zur Weiterbeförderung ange\nnommen. In Ermangelung von\nMarken fertigte man amtlich recht\neckige Papierstücke an, die mit einer\ngriechischen Inschrift und der Wert\nangabe bedruckt wurden. Als diese\nVorräte zu Ende gingen, nahm man,\nwie in Kawalla. bulgarische Marken\nund bedruckte sie ähnlich wie dort.\nSehr selten sind auch die in G\nmüldschina ausgegebenen Provisorien\nzu 10 und 25 Lepta. Diese Stadt\nwar ursprünglich von den Bulgaren\nerobert, wurde aber dann von den\nGriechen besetzt. Im Autarkster\nFrieden sie! sic wieder an Bulgarien,\ndoch tonnte dieses sie nicht sofort be\nsitzen, sodaß die griechische Besatzung\nlänger dorr bleiben mußte. Während\ndieser Zeit hat man nun türiische\nBricsmar\'en, die inan vorfand, mit\neinem mehrzelligen Ueberdruck in\ngriechischer Sprache versehen und\nauch noch das griechische Wappen hin\nzugefügt. To auch viese Marken nur\nin geringer Zabl hergestellt wurden,\nist ihre Selienheit sehr erklärlich.\nSchließlich sah sich auch Bulgarien\nzur Herausgabe einer Serie von l\nl. is 27 Stoiinli mit einem aus den\nAnlaß zu ihrer Herausgabe bezug\nnibmenden Ueberdruck versehen: sie\nwürd, in größerer Anzahl au-geae \'\nlen.

John B. Densmore\nof the department of labor so an\nnounced after a final effort to bring\nthe warring interests together.\nHe did not hesitate to Marne his\nfailure upon the uncompromising at\ntitude of the mine owners, who re\nfused to recognize the Western Fed\neration of Miners as a party to arbi\ntration proceedings or other peace\nprojects.\nDensmore Tells Story.\n“In a nutshell, the question was\nwhether the union men should go back\nto work with or without discrimina\ntion. The companies refused to do\nanything but discriminate against\nmembers of the union,” said Mr. Dens\nmore.\n“It means a struggle to the bitter\nend,” said O. N. Hilton, chief of coun\nsel of the Western Federation of\nMiners, who has represented Presi\ndent C. H. Moyer here since the lat\nter’s deportation. “The outcome is\ndue entirely to the attitude of the\ncompanies. They wanted everything\nand would concede nothing.”\nCompromise Is Rejected.\nThe union’s last word was an offer\nto withdraw the Western federation\nTom the field, its place to be taken by\n. union affiliated with the Michigan\nFederation of Labor, the United Mine\nWorkeis, with which the Western Fed\neration of Miners is affiliated, or some\nsimilar body. This was rejected ab\nsolutely by the companies.\nThe employing interest suggested to\nMr. Densmore that a secret vote of the\nmen on strike, if properly safeguard\ned, would show a majority of them in\nfavor of returning to work outside the\nunion fold. When this was broached\nto the federation men there was an\nimmediate declination to submit the\ncase to any such test. Word of the\nnegotiations was telegraphed to the\nsecretary of labor by Mr. Densmore.\nHe said that a full report of the ef\nforts made would be made by him aft\ner his return to Washington.\nThe strike has been in progress\nsince July 23. Now that Mr. Dens\nmore has given up and is going back\nto Washington, there are prophecies\nthat it will last much longer. J. E.\nRoach, a representative of Samuel\nGompers, president of the American\nFederation of Labor, said:\n“This strike will not be settled for\neight months. It will run longer than\nthat. It will go a year. The American\nfederation will aid the strikers, and\nother organizatinos will help.”\nAttack on Moyer Up to Grand Jury.\nThe Houghton county grand jury\nwas specifically charged by Judge H.\nH. O’Brien of the circuit court to in\nvestigate the kidnaping of Moyer.\nMoyer was forcibly deported, beaten\nand shot.\n“If the jury believes there is reason\nable amount of evidence pointing to\nward persons connected with the kid\nnaping, they are* to be investigated\nand indicted,” Judge O’Brien charged.\nThe grand jury is made up of James\nMacNaughton’s chauffeur, Edgar Bye,\nseveral mine superintendents and two\nSocialists. The evidence is being\nplaced before the grand jury by\nGeorge Nichols, a special prosecutor\nappointed by Governor Ferris to con\nduct the investigation.\nJudge O ltrien has been condemned\nby the mine mauagers and the mem\nbers of the Citizens’ alliance without\nmercy. Placards charging that he\ntried to mediate the strike in the\ncause of the Western Federation of\nMiners have been posted on the bill\nboards in Calumet township, and in\nthe Calumet & Hecla stamp mills one\nof the largest posters is displayed.\nFerris on Way to Calumet.\nCalumet, Mich., Jan. s.—Governor\nFeriis, Labor Commissioner Cunning\nham and Secretary Nesbit will arrive\nin the copper country tonight. The\ngovernor will prosecute a vigorous in\nvestigation of the strike in the hopes\nof bringing about a settlement. He\nis accompanied by several lower\nMichigan labor leaders.\nSilver Wedding.\nMr. and Mrs. Joe Biicb, of Bee\ntown celebrated the twenty-fifth an\nniversary of their wedding Friday\nevening, Dec. 19.

Very much of this criticism\nis bad because it is unsound, untrue,\nand while objecting to tbe existing,\nhas nothing better to substitute. All\nof it is uDfortudate because it lowers\nthe value of a school education in the\nminds of unthinking people who need\nthe school the most. It is not at all\nunusual to find articles in any paper\nor magazine today bearing the title cf\nthis paragraph. Tbe following dis\ncussion which answers tbe question\nnegatively, written hy ,T. W. Red\nvay, is an extract from the Western\nTeacher” for December.\n‘‘l take New York City as an\nexample. Knocking New York schools\nis quite tbe customary habit, and the\nsmall army of efficiency experts can\nfind nothing good about them.\nThree quarters of a million pupils\nattend them and about twenty\nthousand teachers constitute the\nteaching staff. Not far from one\nthird of tbe enrollment cousists of\npupils of foreign birth or are tbe\nchildren of foreign born parents.\nAt the present time the parents are\nmainly Italians, Russian Jews,\nSyrians, Poles, and Greeks They\nare the unskilled laborers and tbe\nvital energy of the sweat shops. So\nfar as tbe parents are concerned the\nproblem is simple. They will live a\nwhile, herded as sheep are herded,\nthen they die, But their children\nare the greatest problem on earth\ntoday. Let us see the work of the\nNew Y 7 ork schools un them, by a\nstudy of the past.\nFifty years ago the Irish formed\nthe chief factor in the unskilled\nlabor population. Walk along any\nbusiness street and one might be sure\nof seeing signs reading— ‘Man wanted ;\nno Irish need apply. ’ Well, the\nadult generation lived and died; that\nwas all. Their children went to the\npublic scbcol. but they were never\nin any great proportion unskilled\nlaborers. The third generation of\nthese Irish immigrants is still living\nin New York City. Who are they,\nand what are they ’ The answer is\neasy : they are the greatest factor in\nthe political and industrial energy of\nthe state—senators, congressman,\nengineers, contracture, clergymen,\neducators and railroad builders. And\nthe Jews of three generations ago?\nbankers, merchants, and capitalists.\nBoth nationalities are furnishmg tbe\nred blood of tbe country today.\nPardon another heresy ; the red blood\nis worth a lot more to the country\nthan the blue blood.\nNow it has been shown that if the\nhuman mind goes without training\nbetween the ages of six and twenty it\nceases to grow. Suppose that all these\nyouugsters of foreigD born parentage\nbad grown up without school train\ning. The answer to this is also easy ;\nthey would have been just what\ntheir grand parents were—the flotsam\nand jetsam of civilization.\nIn the city of Mount Vernon. New\nYork, it costs about six hundred dol\nlars to steer a youngster through the\nelementary aud high schools The\naverage income of one hundred men\ngraduates of the high schol is not far\nfrom fifteen hundred dollars a year.\nAt five percent this is the income on\nthirty thousand dollars. Ia other\nwords, we invest six hundred dollars\nand tbe product commands just fifty\ntimes that sum What a failure!”\nTHE WINTER SHORT COURSE\nMention was made in this column a\nshort time ago of the winter short\ncourses which were being introduced\nin a number of Wisconsin high\nschools this year. From the reports\nia the educational papers, the idea is\nnot wholly confined to this state.\nThe Geneseo, Illinois, Township High\nSchool has begun such a course for\ncountry boys. The course started\nDecember first with an enrollment of\ntwenty-four boys, ranging in age\nfrom fifteen to twenty years, and in\nadvancement, from the eighth grade\nto the third year of the high school.\nThe establishment of the course\nthere is the result of a definite de\nmand on the part of the farmer tax\npayers who have not been receiving\nthe benefits they tbiuk tbey ought to\nhave from the money they are pay\ning, because they need their boys for\nfall and spriug work on the farms.\nInquiries made by Principal Beatty\ndeveloped the fact that there were\nenough of the country boys interest\ned in the proposed coarse to warrant\nthe undertaking, hut it was not ex\npected that the enrollment for the\nfirst year would be more than twelve\nor fifteen.\nFive classes have been organized\nand each student is enrolled for four\nof the five; all but one are in the\nagriculture class.

Bennett.\nJohn H. Bennett was born in Corn\nwall, England, December 24, 1846.\nHe was brought to America with his\npaients when but six months old and\nlived with them in New York two\nyears. He had been a resident of\nSouthwestern Wisconsin forty years—\ntwenty-seven of which he resided in\ntownship of Lancaster. At tbe\nMethodist parsonage in this city he\nwas married on January 1, 1873, to\nMiss Eliza C. Keretzer. Fonr chil\ndren came to bless their home, tbe\neldest, a sweet little girl of two and\none-half years, guing at that early\nage into the heavenly home. The\nonly other daughter, Mamie, in tbe\nbeauty of early womanhood died after\na lingering illness and mourned cf\nmany, April 7, 1908. Suddenly May\n26, 1913 while on a visit to tbe son\nPhil, wbb lived at Mather, this state,\ntbe beloved wife and mother took her\ndeparture for that land from whence\nnone return. Tbe dear body was\nbrought to Lancaster that it might\nrepose beside ber children. The bus\nband was broken hearted and would\nnot be comforted. He had been\ncrippled by disease and for many of\ntbe daily comforts of life was de\npendent upon the loving, faithful\nministries of his wife. None could\ntake her place. For some months be\nremained with his brother aDd sister,\nMr. and Mrs. Philip Beunett where\nhe received all the kindly attention\nthey could bestow. Then the son\nPhil came back to the tld borne in\nthis city where he and his wife tried\nto make tbe father comfortable aud\nhappy But he mourned incessantly,\nand prayed to be delivered of this life\nthat be might be reunited with his\nloved ‘‘Eliza ” Existence tc bim\nwas only a burden without her com\npanionship Had he been strong and\nable bodied, he probably would have\ntaken up bis cross and borne it brave\nly as others do under irreparable\nlosses. In his decrepit state is it any\nwonder be so mourned so loyal a help\nmeet as Bennett was. The lov\ning Father noted his sorrow, and\nheeded tbe cry of bis heart. On the\nmorning of December 19, 1913, while\nsitting in bis chair with not a long\nwarning of his near approach, tbe\ndeath angel touched bim gently and\nhe passed peacefully away. Tbe sons\nGeorge us Mather and Phil of Lancas\nter, with their families other rela\ntives, and friends sorrow for their\nloss—and yet rejoice that the parents\nwere not long divided. Rev. Beavins,\npastor of tbe M. E. church where last\nservices were tendered, spoke beauti\nfully of tbe re-union —tbe joy of the\nfirst Christmai together in a land\nwhere pain of parting never comes.\nThe floral offerings were many.\nFor these and tbe many other kindly\nand consoling offices of friendship tbe\nsurviving relatives are very grateful.\n“Some fair tomorrow we shall know\nLife’s mysteries that hurt us so:\nThe love and wisdom in disguise\nWill then be open to our eyes.”\nb. d. a.\nRaincoats at Ten cents.\nA man in Illinois has invented a\nprocess to produce and market a rain\ncoat that can be retailed from 10\ncents up. These coats are made in\nthe regulation slip on style, from an\nintegral part of waterproof paper.\nTheir production cost will be no\nhigbtr than 5 cents each, and even\nthat figure can be lessened. The coat\ncan be folded np to fit in any ordinary\neuvelope and is particulary adapted\nto bring carried in bandoags\nThe coats can be made of oiled\npaper or paraffin, vellum parchment\npaper, which gives the appearance of\nsilkiness at a short distance. Tbe\noriginal idea was for the coats to be\nworn only once, but after a trial, it\nwas demonstrated tbat they could be\nutilized successfully two or three\ntimes. The coats are re-inforced\nwhere the buttons are sewed on and\nalso where the button holes are cut.\nThere are only two seams, both\nrunning underneath tbe arms and\ndown the sides. These seams are\ncemented by ordinary glue.—New\nYork Times.\nMethodist Church.\nThos. S.

Brocbert,\nrecently printed at The Herald office:\n‘‘Supt. J. C. Brockert, of Grant\nCounty, has issued an annual report\nand school directory for 1918 which is\nvery comprehensive and well il\nlustratesd.

The\nvarious contests, such as those in\nspelling and corn raising are given a\nprominent place in the report.

A mystery\nsurrounds the affair as it is not\nknown who did the shooting. It is\nthought that whoever fired the\nshot, was either trying to kill Mr.\nLoock’s dog or mistook it for a\nTa\'bbit. The dog was close to Mr.\nLoock\'s right leg when the shot was\nfired. The dog was killed and part\nof the charge entered the right leg,\nankle and foot of Loock. He was\nbrought to this city and received\nmedical attention. The wounds while\nnot serious are painful and will prob\nably keep Mr. Loock confined to the\nhouse a week.\nFaxes of Town of Grand Rapids\nare new payable at my office, room\nNo. 5, old Wood County National\nBank block, opposite post office up\nstairs.

Found In Home of\nFriend by Officers.\nThe attempt of Elizabeth Hensehel,\nfifteen years old, to commit suicide,\ncaused a great deal of excitement in\nthe fourth ward Saturday evening.\nMiss Hensehel left home about six\no’clock Saturday evening, because\nshe fea-ed her father. She had stated\nfollowing a beating he had given her\non a previous occasion, that if he\never beat her again she would kill\nherself. She went to the river and\nattempted to get into deep water,\nbut was unsuccessful and finally gave\nit up and wandered to the house of\na friend where she was taken care\nof and afterward found by the offi\ncers.\nAccording to the story told by the\ngirl and the officers, she intended\nto drown herself, hut because of the\nshallow water and ice she did not\nsucceed. It is said that several\nweeks ago her father gave her a\nsevere beating and she made the\nstatement that she would kill her\nself if he ever beat her again. Sat\nurday evening Hensehel learned that\nshe had been to a moving picture\nshow and began to raise a row. The\ngirl fled from the house. Officer\nBanter and Undersheriff Bluett were\nsent for and took up the hunt for the\nmissing girl. She was traced to the\nriver and the place where she| start\ned out on the ice was discovered\nSearch along the hank showed where\nshe had come back to shore. The of\nficers agreed that she had probably\nbeen unable to get to deep water\nand had returned to shore and was\nin the home of some friend. A sys\ntematic search of all the houses in\nthe neighborhood was commenced.\nThe officers were not saitsfied with\nthe verbal denial of the people but\ninsisted upon searching the houses.\nThe girl was finally found at the\nhome of Emil Toeple on Burt street.\nMr. and Mrs. Toeple took the girl\nin and had put her to bed under\nwarm blankets. It was after eleven\no’clock before the sdhrch was over.\nThe father finally arrived and got\nclothing for the girl and took her\nback to her home.\nDISCUSS WORK\nOF CIRCUIT COURT\nSay Double Trial System Should\nBe Abolished.\nThe circuit judges of the state\nhave been in session at Madison,\nwith the committee of lawyers ap\npointed at the last session of the\nlegislature to investigate court sys\ntems.\nThat the double trial system in\nprobate matter® is a drag on the\ncourts and should be abolished, was\none of the decisions reached. Judge\nA. H. Reid of Wausau and others\ndeclared there should be either an\nappeal from county court to .supreme\ncourt or else, when an issue is. join\ned in probate court, that the matter\nbe certified to circuit court for\ntrial.\nThere w r as considerable discussion\nover the proposed abolition of the\noffice of justice of the peace, but\nno decision was reached.\nThis was the first meeting of the\nlegislative committee since appoint\nment. It will report to the next leg\nislature the result of the investiga\ntion and submit a plan that appears\nto best suit the state needs and\nmeet with the approval of the state\njudiciary.\nMonday evening the circuit judges\nwere entertained at a banquet at\nwhich Judge W. J. Turner of Milwau\nkee, spoke of the divorce evil. He\nsaid that probably 5d per cent of the\ndivorces in Milwaukee county might\nhe avoided if anew system of grant\ning divorces was devised. Judge\nTurner believes that the legislature\nshould pass a law creating the posi\ntion of divorce lawyer to be appoint\ned by the circuit judge and no divorc\naction could be brought, except bj\nthis mam. “I think,’’ said Judge\nTurner, “that there are a large\nnumber of divorces brought b> law\nvers’ runners, who have brought out\nan evil as great as the ambulance\nchaser in personal injury cases. Then\ntoo. divorced women often urge wo\nmen who have had a quarrel to get\na lawyer and get a divorce. These\nremarks were made in refernece to\nMilwaukee county cases. Judge Turn\ner said he did not believe that the\nsame conditions prevailed in every\ncounty of the state.\nENDORSES SENATOR HATTON\nThe Eagle-Star is glad to note that\nWilliam H. Hatton of New London,\nis an announced candidate for the\nRepublican gubernatorial nomination.\nWe have contended for months that\nhe was the key to the situation for\nthe Republicans of Wisconsin. No\nother man, so far mentioned, com\nbines all the qualities necessary in\na candidate for the chief executive\nship, as he does. The Republicans of\nWisconsin have before them the big\ngest state fight of two decades. The\nstate situation, a Democratic presi\ndent in the chair, favor the opposi\ntion and it will need all the resources\nof a united Republican party to carry\nthe next state election. Mr. Hatton\nwill unite the parties as no other\nman can and is an ideal man for\nthe Then why not do\nthe logical thing. Republicans, and\nnominate him?—Marinette Eagle-Star\nMOTOR NUMBERS\nCO OUTOF STILE\nNew Number Plates of a Better\nDesign\nMOTORIST TO BE GIVEN TIME\nState is Unable to Provide Applicants\nWith License Numbers —Sorpe\nNew Numbers Here.\nRaus mat the 1913 automobile num\nbers. They went out of date at mid\nnight Wednesday, That was the last\nsecond that the 1913 licenses were\ngood. A few Grand Rapids automo\nbile owners already have their new\nnumbers. Those who have declare\nthat they are an improvement over\nthe 1913 numbers, because they are\nof better make-up and are more dis\ntinguishable.\nThe 1914 number plates are made\nfrom one piece of sheet steel, the\nnumber being pressed into relief in\nstead of tacked on as they wqre\nin 1913. The background of the num\nber plate is ena.maled white and the\nnumbers are enameled black, conse\nquently the Wisconsin number plate\nhave about all the contrast colors\nwill permit.\nThe new numbers are slightly\nwider than the §ld onesi, and the fact\nthat they are pressed from the steel\nplate instead of tacked on to it will\nmake it easier for motorists to keep\nt v -cl 0 ? -\'V fl .ip e&jbi q s-ha l^ ■\nNo one will be arrested: if he de\nports himself on country roads or\ncity streets with the 1913 number\nplate attached. The state department\nis so swamped with applications for\nnew numbers that it is impossible to\nissue new numbers fast enough. The\nfact that there are more automobiles\nin service this winter than ever be\nfore has only served to increase the\nrush of applicants.\nThe law, leisurely interpreted, give\nmotorists time enough to get their\nnumbers and run with the old ones\non until they do, because the state\nknows that before very much time\nelapses new numbers will be procur\ned. So apply for new numbers and\ndrive with the old ones until the\nstate sends you the new black and\nwhit© figures.\nTWO APPOINTED\nOK COUNTY JUDGE\nSoldier.s Relief Committee Now\nComplete Again.\nThe vacancies on the Soldiers’\nRelief Committee have been filled\nby County Judge - W.

By the time the offi\ncer got through he had a collection\nof three of the most interesting\n“gats” that have come to light in\nthis community in years. One gun\nwas a short regular British Bull Dog\nrevolver, another was a double bar\nreled derringer of about 44 caliber\nand the last was a four barreled\nbrass muzzle loading outfit that must\nhave been handed down from the\nearly German wars. Two of the guns\nwere found loaded.

This report\nwas adopted. It is believed that if no\nchange is decided upon the war depart\nment will be urged to condemn the\npresent bridge as an obstruction to\nnavigation.\nPlumb reported orally for the elec\ntric committee that the city assumed\npossession of the electric light plant\nlast Friday, January 2nd; that the ap.\npraiser from Madison had agreed with\nthe company and committee on the val\nue of supplies and extensions made\nsince January 1, 1913, at SBSOO, and\nseveral smaller details. The electric\nplant is now a municipal utility owned\nand operated by the city, and tempor\narily managed by the electric commit\ntee of the city council, composed of\nRalph Plumb, Charles Frazier and\nMartin Georgenson, who with the at\ntorney conducted all the negotiations\nwith Mr. John Schuette for closing\nthe transfer. They report that all\ndealing with Mr. Schuette was pleas\nant, he meeting them more than half\nway on all open points. The total cost\nwas $146,000. Bonds to cover this,\nwhich the company will take, are be\ning printed.\nAn ordinance was introduced prohi\nbiting, except in certain specified cas\nes, the blowing of boiler Hues of steam\nships in the harbor.

The chief wants\na motorcycle to make more certain the\nhaling to justice of the motor speed\nfiends. The police committee will re\nport on this. He also expressed his\nthanks to everyone except the Daily\nNews.\nThe mayor has an idea that it would\nbe a good plan to buy the lot aAolnirg\nthe Franklin street fire station, evi\ndently having a future city hail in\nview. It excited some debate. Thori\nson is against the hall idea, / Plumb\nagainst the site. The finance commit\ntee will get a price on tho lot.\nThe Judicairy committee will get a\nprice, if possible, on the Vilas lot, be\ntween the stand pipe and the Schuette\nresidence. This caused more airing of\nideas. Tho mayor thinks the railroad\nbridges will some day be ordered re\nmoved.\nThe fire committee recently put pav\ning brick floors in the horse stalls at\nthe north side station where 5 of the 7\nhorses are kept. Schroeder, Lippen\nand Scherer made a vigorous attack on\nthis scheme claiming it lames the\nhorses. Thorison and chief Kratz up\nheld the other side.

Business was\nentirely suspended in this town during\nFriday, Saturday and Monday—no oue\nbeing able to be out doors any length\nof time.

In this section we have\nheard of but few sufferers. One un\nfortunate fellow, residing in Brown\ncounty, had both his feet frozen so\nbadly that it was at first supposed he\ncould not live, but through the skill\nful efforts of Dr. Balcom, ho is in k\nfair way to recover, though amputation\nof one of the limbs was found to be\nnecessary.\nA Large Establishment — Mr.\nWilliam liabr, the well known Brewer\nhas just completed a very large estab\nlishment for the manufacture of lager\nbeer, and at his invitation many of our\ncitizens visited his cellar on Saturday\nlast.

Vet\nthese are the very places most in need\nof it. In the larger centers competent\ndoctors are available, and in the cities\nfree medical and dental clinics may al\nways be found, but in the country med\nical and dental attention is often diffi\ncult to obtain.\nAgain, people in the country are\nlittle inclined to seek aid from physic\nians or dentists, simply because they\nhave not yet been educaflAi to do so\nexcept in serious cases. It therefore\nhappens that children of the rural\nschools are in general (contrary to the\ngeneral impression) more in need of\nmedical and dental attention than the\nchildren of larger communities.\nThere is also a common impression\nthat country children are naturally\nmore vigorous than city children.\nr i his ought to bo true, but unfortun\nately it is not. In general food is not\nas well prepared in the country as it\nis in the city; the available variety is\nsmaller; the houses and schools are\nless well ventilated, overheating in\nwinter is common; tuberculosis is not\nso well understood and the chances for\n“house infection” are therefore great\ner; and general public sanitation is\nalmost without exception neglected in\nthe country.\nChildren in the country are more ex\nposed to unfavorable weather condi\ntions than are city children. They of\nten walk long distances in extreme\nheat, cold, or wet; and sit in school\nwith damp clothing or wet feet. They\nalmost invariably wear 100 much cloth\ning indoors in cold weather, and are\nconsequently overheated in the school\nroom and then are chilled on the way\nhome. Under such conditions it is no\nwonder that colds and other respira\ntory disorders are common, and that\nmany country children are out of\nschool on account of various kinds of\nsickness\nTin sanitation of a rural school is\nusually very bad. The common drink\ning cup hangs from a nail over the\nwater pail; floors and desks are often\nvery dirty; ventilation is a negligible\nquantity; outdoor toilets are in un\nspeakable condition; washing facilities\nare either not provided at all, or con\nsist of a pail of water, a dirty tin basin,\nand one common towel.- From U, S.\nliureau of Kducation Letter.\nThe above letter needs to be heeded\nat this time of the year. There is\nmuch sickness throughout the county\nand city. Several schools were closed\nbefore the holidays. School boards\ncannot give the matter of fumigation\ntoo much attention at this time. The\nschool house ought to disinfected fre\nquently now. Some children catch\ndiseases from each other very readily.\nTake alt necessary precaution, it is\ncheaper than paying doctor bills, and\nmay prevent an epidemic in the com\nmunity.\nBl) v LAND ON EASY TEHMS.\nCut over hard wood lands in Wiscon\nsin, from 915.00 per acre up. 91 00 per\nacre cash, balance in monthly install\nments of 9. r j.oo on each forty (.ought.\nNo better proiswltion known.

The missing girl\'s father\nclosed his business in Marshfield and\ntraced hi3 daughter\'s progress from\nthe moment she left her home. The\npolice were notified, but until\nWednesday morniDg nothing was\nknown beyond that she had been seen\non the train at Merrillan. On Wed\nnesday morning Mr. Engelman re\nceived word from the marshall at Wild\nRose that a girl answering to Miss\nEagelman’s description had taken a\ntrain for Pine River.\nHer father left immediately for Pine\nRiver and found his daughter on the\npoint of leaving for parts unknown\nwith a young woman companion. Tae\nlatter, who has been employed at the\nEngelman home at Marshfield\nand who was twenty-two\nyears of age, unbeknownst to the other\nmembers of the family, had induced\nLillian to promise to leave her home\non some pretense or other and meet\nher at Pine River where the twain ex\npected to “run away”.

On my way I met Elmer\nJohnston in front of his store and he\nasked me where I got the package. I\ntold him on East street between Reul’s\nplaning mill and the cemetery.

The man\nbought a piece of property eleven\nyears ago and failed to have the deed\nrecorded. Lately he had a chance to\nsell the property and when he was\nabout to make the deal he discovered\nthat for certain reasons his title was\nnot perfect, and in order for him to\nmake the sale it would have to be\nmade so. He consulted local abstract\nagents and he was not a little shocked\nwhen he wp.s set back over SIOU for\nhaving the title made perfect.\nDescended of Roger Williams.\nThe last issue of the Prairie du Sac\nNews contains an obituary sketch of\nRev.

While in Baraboo he\nvisited at the home of Mr. and Mrs.\nD. A. Lewis. He was a deßcendent of\nRoger Williams on his father’s ide\nand his mother was of the Mayflower\nFuller family.

Rooney of Chicago, who has\ninterested himself in the municipal\nChristmas tree plans has sent a letter\nto Mayor Head offering to donate to\nthe city of Kenosha a great pine tree\nto be planted somewhere in the city\nand to be used as a perpetual Christmas\ntree. Rooney furnished the municipal\ntree to Chicago this year. The proposi\ntion is that he will ship the tree to Ke‘-\nnosha with the soil frozen about the\nroots and he holds that if it is planted\nunder such conditions that the transfer\nof it from the northern forests to Ke\nnosha will in no way retard its growth.\nRooney plans to ship trees to seventy\ncities in Illinois, Indiana and Wiscon\nsin.\nMayor Head declared today that he\nwas favorable to the proposition and he\nsuggested that the tree be secured and\nset up in the Market Square Park at\nthe intersection of Church street\nSTARTS ON 810 TASK\nMayor Head Busy Investi\ngating Petitions Asking\nFor Commission Form.\nSMALL MARGIN TO WORK ON\nI\nMayor Declares That He Wil. 1 Rush the\nWork of Investigation and Is»,.t For\nmal Proclamation Just as Soon as Ha\nIs Satisfied With the Petitions.\nMayor Dan 0. Head has started the\narduous task of checking up the names\non the petitions demanding a referen\ndum on the commission form of govern\nment. At the last general election in\nthe city there were 4,010 votes cast for\nall the candidates for mayor and in or\nder to have the question of the com\nmission form submitted to the people\nthe petitions now in the hands of the\nmayor must contain the names of 1,010\nqualified electors of tne city of Keno\nsha. The petitions contain exactly\n1,027 names so that the margin is but\nseventeen and it is probably that this\nwill be reducted by the elimination of\nduplicate signatures. Mayor Head will\nprobably he abb to complete the ex\namination of the names on the petition\nwithin two weeks and if he is satisfied\nthat the number is sufficient he will\nlose no time in issuing his proclama\ntion. Under the law the election must\nbe held within sixty days after the\npresentation of the petition and the\nproclamation of the mayor must be is\nsued within thirty days in order to\ngive time for the preliminaries to the\nprimary.\nThe law provides that should the com\nmission form be adopted by the refer\nendum vote that the candidates for\nmayor and for councilmen must be\nnominated at a regular primary elec\ntion. This primary is to be held under\nthe law which has governed city pri\nmaries in the past. The candidates\nmust silo affidavits of their candidacy\nat least twenty days before the date\nset for the primary and the affidavits\nmust be accompanied by a petition\nsigned by at least twenty-five electors.\nAll petitions must be circulated at\nlarge and under the commission form\nward lines will be entirely w : ped out.\nSome of the opponents to the com\nmission form lave insisted already that\nthe petition is insufficient, they holding\nthat the law demands that the petition\nbe signed by one-fourth of the number\nof electors who voted at the last gen\neral election. T\' iy hold that many\nvotes were cast blank for the office of\nmayor and that the total number of\nall the votes cast was largely in\nexcess of the number received by the\nthree actual candidates. The reading\nof the law appears to be plain and it\nstates that the petitions shall be sign\ned by twenty-five per cent of the votes\ncast for all candidates for mayor. No\nmention of the blank votes is made in\nthe law. This matter has been referred\nto the «city attorney for a decision.\nThe clans have already begun to line\nup for and against the proposed change\nin the form of government of the city.\nMany of the workingmen of the city\nseem to be committed to the new form\nand it has a large support among the\nheavier tax payers of the city. The\nplan is opposed by the men who have\nbeen active in politics as these men\n, seem to prefer the old form.\n“It will take a long while to get\nover these petitions,” said Mayor Head\nin discussing the matter. “There are\na lot of names on them that I have\nnever heard of and I shall be forced\nto refer to poll lists i 1 order to satis\nfy myself that the petitions contain the\nrequisite number of electors. Just as\nsoon as I am convinced that this is true\nI will make the proclamation provided\nby the state law.”\nONE MAN RELEASED.\nJulius Elbi Arrested on Charge of Aid\ning Fugitive Released on Tuesday.\nJulius Elbi, one of the Italians ar\nrested on Monday night on charges of\nhaving aided in the escape of Peter\nCovalla, who was charged with attempt\ned murder, was released on Tuesday\nnight at the order of District Attorney\nAL. Drury. The district attorney held\n; that the evidence was not sufficient to\nhold Elbi for a preliminary hearing in\nthe municipal court. This morning a\nformal complaint was issued for the ar\nrest of James Jendi, who is charged\nwith having furnished the money to\nCovalla to go to Italy. The hearing\nwill be taken up in the municipal court\n■ late this afternoon or Thursday morn\npng.

JANUARY 8, 1914.\nSHOWS BIG INCREASE\nPostal Receipts of Kenosha\nPostoffice Jump $15,000 in\nthe Year of 1913.\nANNUAL HEPOfIT ISSUED TODAY\nPostmaster and Assistants Are Hopeful\nThat Kenosha Wid Supplant Green\nBay as Sixth in List of Postoffices in\nWisconsin in the Annual Report.\nAssistant Postmaster Michael F.\nZeus today .issued his annual report of\nthe receipts of the Kenosha postoffi.ee\nin the sale of stamps and this report\nshows that the year 1913 brought a re\ncord increase in the business of the\nKenosha postoffice. So great is the in\ncrease that the officials of the local of\nfice are of the opinion and entertain\nhigh hopes that Kenosha will supplant\nGreen Bay as the sixth office in the\nstate in the matter of stamp sales.\nKenosha jumped over Sheboygan in the\nreport made by Postmaster Welch of\nEau Claire, a year ago, and it is expect\ned that the statistics of the state ofiices\nto be issued some time this month will\ngive Kenosha another boost. This will\nmake it sixth with Oshkosh fifth\nand Oshkosh is so far ahead of Keno\nsha that it is feared that it will be\nseveral years before the Kenosha office\ntakes an upward step in the list of the\noffices of the state.\nThe increase in the postal receipts\nof the local office over the receipts in\n1912 is more than fifteen thousand dol\nlars, the largest increase ever showm in\nan annual report. The business of the\nparcel post system is reflected in this\nyear\'s business, but at that the busi\nness of the office for December is only\n$450 greater than the bigness of the\npreceding year. • I!LL-the fir#\nten thousand dollar month in the sale\nof stamps in the Kenosha office, the re\nceipts for the month of May passing\nthe ten thousand mark and being more\nthan $3,000 greater than the receipts in\nthe same month last year.\nThe report sent out this year com\npares the receipts of the office over a\nterm of eleven years. It shows that in\n1902 the receipts of the office (postal)\nwere $22,627.88, considerably less than\none-fourth of the receipts during the\nyear just closed. In 1907 the receipts\nhad jumped to $48,996.67; in 1910 they\nreached $63,855.69; in 1911, $75,361.42;\nin 1912, $83,503.38, and in 1913,\n$98,815.86.\nIt will be noted that the increase in\nthe sales for the last year was within\nseven thousand dollars of the increase\nin the five years from 1902 to 1907.\nThe monthly sales of stamps for 1913,\nas compared with 1912, are as follows:\n1912. 1913.\nJanuary $ 7,338.85 $ 8.591.51\nFebruary 5,518.16 7,244.83\nMarch 8,057.43 9,143.30\nApril 6,155.74 9,208,27\nMay 7,026.72 10,189.08\nJune 5,715.59 7,575.21\nJuly 6,812.44 7,768.93\nAugust 7,074.47 6,564.30\nSeptember 6,443.15 8,272.42\nOctober 7,168.76 7,339.26\nNovember 6,439.95 7,016.36\nDecember 9,455.12 9,905.39\nTotals $83,503.38 $98,815.86\nMUST CARE FOR HYDRANTS.\nWater Commission Would Put Fire Pro\ntection in Charge of Department.\nThe water commission at its regular\nsession on Tuesday night took steps to\nput all work in connection with the\nmaintenance of the fire hydrants under\nthe charge of the chief of the fire de\npartment. In order to make this pos\nsible the commission ds planning to in\nstall special taps, which may be used\nby patrons having contracts for street\nsprinkling and after these taps are put\nin the street sprinklers will not be per\nmitted to take water from the fire\nhydrants under any consideration. The\nmembers of the commission spent more,\nthan an hour discussing filtration plans\nbut nothing of a definite nature was\ndone.

F. Bidin\nger and Postmaster Daniel Grady came\nto Kenosha to be the guests of the\nKenosha Council. They came on a spe\ncial car and they came prepared to\ntake charge of all the proceedings of\nthe evening and when they marched in\nto the council hall the officers of the\nKenosha Council yielded their chairs\nto the visitors and all that the Kenosha\nmembers had to do was to spread the\nglad hand and accept the splendid en\ntertainment provided by the visiting\nknights.\nThe Waukegan team had charge of\nthe regular meeting of tht, council and\nafter the work was completefl Mayor\nBidinger was introduced as master of\nceremonies and for an hour the visit\ning knights put on an entertainment\nthat made the Kenosha members of the\norder sit up and take notice.\nThere were musical numbers and\nvaudeville stunts furnished by the vis\nitors and there were addresses breach\ning fraternal greetings by the Wauke\ngan mayor. Postmaster Grady, Louis\nDurkin, John Broderick. John Reardon\nand James Gallagher. Every one of the\nsp<nkcrs had to say. The\nWaukegan visitors urged a closer rela\ntionship between the members of the\norder in Kenosha and Waukegan, and\nspoke of the common interest of all in\nthe advancement of the Work of the\nKnights of Columbus. There were\ntoasts to the order and to its work in\ntwo of the great states in the union.\nAfter the Waukegan men had sang\nand talked themselves tired the Keno\nsha members showed that they were not\nlacking in hospitality and led the way\nto rhe banquet hall where a dinner was\nserved at which covers were laid for\nmore than 150. After dinner was over\nthere was more talking and more good\nfellowship. The members of the Ke\nnosha Council accepted an invitation to\nhave charge of the next meeting of the\nWaukegan Council, and an effort will\nbe made to have at least a hundred\nKenosha knights visit Waukegan on\nthat occasion.\nThis promises to be a banner year\nfor the Kenosha Council and already\nmore than forty applications have been\nreceived. It is planned to arrange for\nthe initiation of a class of more than\n60 members in about two months and\nthis class initiation will be made the\noccasion of one of the biggest gather\nings ever held by the Kenosha Council.\nBIG SUIT IS SETTLED.\nSIO,OOO Suit Brought by Angelo Copen\nAgainst Brass Co. Dismissed Today.\nIn the municipal cpurt this morning\nJudge Randall handed down a formal\norder dismissing the suit brought by\nAngelo Copen against the Chicago Brass\ncompany in which the plaintiff had de\nmanded damages to the amount of $lO,-\n000. The order for dismissal of the sun\nwas based on a stipulation of the at\ntorneys in the case which indicated\nthat the case had been settled out of\ncourt, but no facts in regard to the na\nture of the settlement were made pub\nlic. The attorneys for the defendant\ncompany had filed a demurrer demand\ning the dismissal of the action and the\nmotion was under consideration by the\ncourt when the notice of settlement\nwas received.

AH this\ngoes to show that the crowded condi- ■\ntion.of the labor market is due more’\nto the influx of outside mechanics than i\nL to idle people al home. t\nSEEK REBATE RELEASES.\nCity Attorney Draws Formal Release\nfor Market Square Paving Rebates.\nThe city officials are planning to ef\nfect an early settlement of the question\nof the payment of rebates for paving\non the south side of Market Square by\nthe, railway company and City Attorney\nSlater is bow drawing releases to be\nsigned by each of the property owners.\nThe city has agreed to pay to the prop\nerty owners one-half of the amount re\nbated by the company. It is claimed\nthat every property owner on the south\nside of the square with a single excep\ntion has agreed to sign the release.\nThe exception will probably be taken\ncare,of by the railway company.

He de\nclares that to get the greatest ef\n| ficiency from the splendid apparatus\ni provided by the city that more men\n■ are necessary. He seeks to have added\nj men at each of the stations and men\nlto take care of a new station to ba\nbuilt next summer if possible. In addi\ntion to this the chief declares that the\nrebuilding of the fire alarm system is<\n! now a necessity. He holds that during\nI the year alarms have failed to come ini\non account of the condition of the ap\ni paratus at the city hall. His sugges\ntion is that the system be divided into\nsix circuits in order to make it easier\nto locate the breaks. At the present\ntime there are but two circuits. He sug\ngests the installation of a six circuit*\ni repeater and the exchanging nf the\nI nresent two circuit switch board for anj\nj C\'ght circtl L . board. JSit\'h changes\n•Auld no s <J; ,v f or |]j e\ndiate demands of the department, but\'\nalso for the future. He asks that the\ncity provine at once for the installation!\nof eight new fire alarm boxes. The’\ncouncil has already taken up the ques\ntion of the erection of a new station 1\non West Grand avenue and the mem\nbers of the council are divided as to\nthe necessity of such an expenditure at\nthis time but it is not improbable that*\nthe new house will be ordered before 1\nthe end of the present year. No ap\n\' propriation has leen made for the erec-\nI tion of the horse in the annual budget\ni of the citv. tut this is not a bar to the\nbuilding of the house as there was no\nappropriation made for the new build*\ning in the third ward recently com\ni pleted.\nThe annual report of the chief con\ntains a lot of interesting statistics. It\nshows that the value of apparatus own\ned by the city for fire purposes is well\nover $25,000 and that Kenosha has the\nonly complete motor fire service to be\nfound in the state of Wisconsin. The\nreal estate and buildings owned by the\ncity and used for the fire department\nare value at $50,000. The report shows\nthat during the year the department was\ncalled out ninety-nine times and of this\nnumber of calls but twenty were box\ncalls. The total loss on buildings and\nstocks during the year amounted to\n$8,820 and this loss was covered by an.\ninsurance of many times its amount.\nThe majority of the fires attended dur\ning the year were small blazes in which\nthe loss was less than SSO and the larg\nest loss reported was $2,000. This loss’\nwas entirely covered by insurance.\nThe financial report is interesting.\nIt shows thai the cost of maintenance\nof the department for the year was\n$29,946.47. Of this amount $14,712.52\nwas paid out in salaries to the members\nof the department and $7,518.65 was\nexpended for real estate and buildings.\nThe expenses for apparatus during the\nfiscal year amounted to $4,861.74, this\nbeing the amount paid for new appara\ntus after deducting the amounts re\nalized by the city by sale of old;\napparatus.\nIn his report the chief pays high tri\nbute to the work of the men under him,\'\ndeclaring that they have at all times\nbeen faithful to their duties and that\nthey have rendered most efficient’\nservice to the city.\nThe recommendations of the chief\nwill be taken up at an early meeting\nof the council.\nThe jury which heard the ei iilenee ia\nthe suit of John Stocker vs. Adam Win\ntieski and others, reached a verdict late\non Tuesday afternoon finding for the\nplaintiff and fixing the amount he should\nrecover at $65.25.\nThe Kenosha and Racinr high school\nbasketball teams will clash in the first\ngame of the season in Racine on Friday\nevening.

Besonders kraß ist die Wir\nkung der neuen Kleidervorschrist an\njenem Oktobertage des Jahres her\nvorgetreten, wo die Prä\nsidcntschast mitrat. Es liegen darü\nber recht erheiternde Berichte vor. Tie\n„verbotene Stadt" mit ihrer Farben\npracht bot sonst bei festlichen Gete\ngenheiten ein herrliches Bild, man\ndenke an die bunten, Lrokatenen ober\nseidenen Fcsigcwänücr, an Pccten und\nStickereien, und sielte sich vor, daß an\nStelle dessen das eintönige Schwarz\nder e\'.iropa.chcn Kleivung getreten ist.\nAllein, was für eine europäische Klei\ndung! Die chinesischen Schneider\nhatten sich gewiß aste erdenkliche Mühe\ngegeben, ihrc Landsleute richtig aus\nzuputzen, allein gelangen war cs ih\nnen nicht: von oben bis unten steck\nten die Chinesen nicht in Kleidern,\nsondern in Karikaturen von Kleidern.\nNatürlich trugen sie Zvtinderhüte, Zy\nlinderhüie in jeglicher Hohe, nur inchl\nin der in Europa üolichen, aus zeg\nlichem Stoff, nur nicht dem, den die\nAbendländer dazu verwenden. Und\nwie man einen Zylinder zu tragen\nhat, wußten sie natürlich auch nicht.\nEinige hasten ihre Behauptungen bis\nauf die Ohren heruntergezogen, an\ndere suchten sie unmittelbar über den\nAugenbrauen im Gleichgewicht zu\nhalten, vielen aber spielte die An\nziehungskraft Ler Erde einen argen\nStreich unv z>rng sie fortgesetzt,\ndurch Nachhelfen mit den Händen das\nverlorengehende Gleichgewicht aufs\nneue wieder h-rzustesten.

Bon\neiner „Fasson" im Sinne eines eu\nropäischen Schneiders war auch nicht\nallzuviel zu entdecken, denn die Grö\nßenverhältnissc der einzelnen Teile\nzu einander waren meistens mißlun\ngen, und man sah Nocke, die lächerlich\nkurz waren, uno anocre, deren Schöße\nbis aus die S:.: :I hingen.\nAm meisten , cywierigteiten hasten\naugenscheinlich K:.- cn und K.-nvatte\nbereitet.

In\nden Buchten von EanneS und Antivcs\nsowie vor der Mündung des Var sin\nden sich untermeerische Quellen, die\nsich bei ruhiger See durch Aufwallen\nverraten. Auch in der Umgebung r\nRhonemünduiigkn treten submarine\nQuellen und oft in beiräckttichec\nTiefe auf. Die mächtigste ist die von\nPort Miou bei Cassis, sie bricht aus\neinem der 2 Quadratmeter großen\nFelsentore mit solcher Gewalt hervor,\ndaß sie an der Mccresorftäche einen\nStrom hervorruft, der schwimmende\nGegenstände oft über 2 Kilometer weit\nforttreibt. Im Golf von Spezia gidt\nes eine Anzahl zudmariner Queucn,\nvon denen ine so mächtig ist, daß sic\nan der Oberfläche der See einen\nWafferhügel erzeugt, der für kleine\nFahrzeugs unnahbar ist. Zahlreich-\'\nuntermeerische Quellen gibt es längs\nder Küsten von Istrien und Dalma\ntien.\nWenden wir uns nach Amerika, \'o\ntreffen wir auf die auch von Hum\nboldt geschilderten gewaltigen Süß\nwafserqucllcn in der Bucht von Ta\ngua und Kuba. Sie treten mit gro\nßer Kraft an der Meeresoberfläche\nhervor, und bisweilen ergänzen dort\nSchiffe ihren Vorrat an Süßwafler.\nZwischen den Rissen, welche die höh\nlenreichen Bahama-Jnseln umgeben,\nquillt klares, frisches süßes Quell\nwasser empor, das um so reiner und\nkälter ist, je tiffer e- geschöpft wird.\nZur Zeit der Ebbe kann man die\nQuellen deutlich sehen und das Was\nser da schöpfen, wo es aus dem Bo\nden emporsprudelt. In der Nähe der\nInsel Saba in den Kleinen Antillen\nwurde mitten im Meer das Vorhan\ndensein einer bedeutenden Süßwasser\nmasse entdeckt, die in konzentrischen\nKreisen vom Meeresboden aufzuquel\nlen schien. Nahe der Küste von Uuka\ntan gibt es untermeerische Tüßwasser\nquellen, die ihrc Wasser nicht in\nschmalen Becken mir einer gewissen\nGeschwindigteit ausströmen, icnstern\ngewissermaßen ausgebreireicn Seen\ngleichen, die keine merkliche Strömung\nzeigen. Diese Sützwassermaffrn schei\nnen landeinwärts eine große \'Ausdeh\nnung zu besitzen, denn dort befinden\nsich natürliche Brunnen, zu denen die\nAnwohner aus Leocrii durch küu\'ilicke\nund natürliche Schächte bina:steigen,\num sich den Bedarf an Triiikwasser\nzu holen.\nEine merkwürviae hierhin gehörige\nErscheinung sin! stch Lei Reclus.\nIm Januar 18.17 war das ganze\nMeer an der Südspitze von Florida\nder Schauplatz eines acwastigen Süß\nwosser Ausbruch-.

Secretary and Treasurer, j\nDated January 13,1914. *\nESTABLISHED 1856\nBE SURE OF YOUR FOOTING\nJohn Stoll Doost Vernon County and\n“Old Wisconsin’’\nPasadena, California, January 2.\nFriend Munson: Just a few lines\nthrough the CENSOR, to my inquiring\nfriends: lam rot selling any real es\ntate, but have had a grand trip for the\npast ten days We went to Chicago in\nthe snow on the 23d of December. In\na short time were on the bare land again\nin Illinois. On the morning of the 24th\nwe had plenty of snow again, which\nlasted to nearly Sacr. ento City, Cali\nfornia, and plenty of it, and winter\nright. Part of the way was like real\nWisconsin winter weather. We spent\nChrisimas and the next day in Salt Lake\nCity looking over many things new to\nus. The temple square containing the\ntemples and tabernacle and its bureau\nof information, all of which we were\nglad to be shown. Also were in St.\nMary’s cathedral and at many other\npoints of interest.\nWe landed at San Francisco on Sun\nday morning, leaving winter behind,\nwhere sunshine and rain have made\nplenty of green grass, which looks fine\nfor winter time. While in San Fran\ncisco I met Frank Onley, formerly of\nViola, who think* that part of Califor\nnia is the only country. Mr. Onley said\nit had been too dry since 1909, only\nwhere they could irrigate the land, and\nthe rain was what they wanted. Since\nleaving San Francisco I see they are\nhaving floods and washouts, trains laid\nup and many of the farmers in low lands\nwiped out of house and home in the val\nleys of upper California.\nWe spent two days in Frisco observ\ning what could be seen by tourists, (or\ncountry people as they call us) went\nthrough Chinatown, where they claim\nthirty thousand Chinamen,and of which\nplenty were small ones. We left for\nLob Angeles and Pasadena arriving on\nJanuary Ist, 1914, and from this far-olf\ncity we wish one and all at home a hap\npy and prosperous New Year. We\nwatched the grand parade of the rose\ntournament. There were some grand\nfloats, and many of them. The parade\nlasting over an hour, as we were in one\nplace all that time. In the afternoon\nwe were at the park where there were\nmany races—chariot, hurdle and foot\nracing, high jumping, many things of\ninterest which made the first day of the\nyear a busy one for us. >\nIt is all right and fine at this time of\nthe year and we enjoy being here. The\nfreeze of 1913 was bad for the ranchers\nhere and I am of the opinion farming\nis not in its highest state. There is\nlots of wealth but I am of the strong\nopinion a great deal of it was made in\nthe east. At any rate, Viroqua and\nVernon county looks good to us, and\nnowhere have we seen any more pros-\nBerous country than old Wisconsin.\n(any who have been in the west for\nyears will hardly believe in the advance\nin the enst. but I for one can tell them\nof the modern farm homes, and that\nour farmers of today are on the top\nrow with the cash in their jeans, and\nthe best is none too good for them.\nUps and downs hit most of us some\ntime in life, no matter where we go.\nTb- whole thing in this life is in being\nsatisfied and contented, and this leads\nme to say: be sure you have something\n1 letter than Vernon county before you\nmake any change, as Wisconsin and\nVernon county are to me at the head of\nthe list. Mv wife says to me “be a\nbooster for Wisconsin.” That is what\nthey do in Pasadena.\nYours, J. E. Stoll.\nRoger the Whole Works\nHon. Roger Williams of Hillsboro,\nwho, as justice, lias doubtless married\nmore couplea than any man in Vernon\ncounty, gives notice how to wed with\nout license er medical examination. In\nthe Sentry he advertises:\n“To all those who contemplate mar\nriage in future and wish to wed under a\nsolemn contract, which is binding and\nlawful under the laws of this state, I\nwill draw up for them. The common\nlaw prevails in this state. All that is\nnecessary to do for two people who wish\nto be married is to make b written\nstatement, before witnesses, that they\ntake each other as man and wife. You\ndon’t require any license, medical ex\namination, priest, clergyman or magis\ntrate.”\nDetermined to Hoist Head Officers\nModern Woodmen everywhere are\nsounding the slogan for defeat of pres\nent head officers of the society, who\nwere instrumental in attempting to\nforce the outrageous increase in rates.\nThe local camps will elect delegates at\nthe first meeting in February to attend\na county convention to be held in Viro\nqua later. Camps are entitled to ore\ndelegate for each 26 members. Every\nWoodman in the county should attend\nthe meeting cf his local camp at the\nfirJt February meeting and have a full\nrepresentation at the county convention.\nThe unhorsing of head officers can only\nbe accomplished by moral support and\ndetermination of members.\nChance for More State Inspectors\nIce cream dealers and traders in oys\nters ate now required tn conform with\nanew regulation by the weight and\nmeasures department of the state. Pa\nper ice cream and oyster containers\nmust be filled to a certain height and\nbe marked by a perforated line accom\npanied by the words" Fill to the Mark.”\nThe capacity of the paper bucket must\nalso be plainly indicated on tbe side or\ntop.\nImportant to Threshermen\nAnnual convention of the Wisconsin\nBrotherhood of Threshermen will be\nheld in Madison city January 20th and\n21st. Every tbresherman in the state,\nwhether a member of the association or\nnot, is welcome to attend this conven\ntion and the special attraction on the\nevening of the 20th in the shape of a\n“Dutch Lunch” and smoker.

Er stirbt unter der Sand\nwelle, die seinen Wafferlauf allmählich\nverschüttet, einen Lauf, der für die\nEwigkeit bestimmt schien. Aber lang\nsam ist der Euphrat vor den eindrin\ngenden Sandmassen zurückgewichen,\nund jetzt rüstet er sich vollends zum\nSterben, wie vor ihm die Wunder\nstädte dahingesiecht sind, die sich an\nseinen Ufer erhoben. So verschwin\ndet mit ihm eins der Weltwunder, das\nder Phantasie die lachendsten Bilder\nvon Glück und Wohlstand vorzaubert;\ndenn mit dem Nil zusammen ist der\nEuphrat der berühmteste Fluß der\nErde, der die älteste Zivilisation der\n„heidnischen Welt blühen und ver\ngehen sah." Ja, die jüngsten Ent\ndeckungen haben sogar den Beweis er\nbracht, daß er überhaupt wohl die\nälteste Zivilisationsquelle darstellt,\nweil allem Anscheine nach die Begrün\nder des Pharaonenreichcs vom Persi\nschen Golf kamen. Es war die chal\ndäiscke Technik, die der ägyptischen\nKunst die Mittel zu ihrer Entwick\nlung gab.\nMesopotamien war im Innern eine\nvon der Sonne ausgedörrte Wüste,\nund allein die Kanalisierung des\nEuphrats brachte es fertig, diese\nWüste der Kultur zugänglich zu ma\nchen. Jahrhunderte gingen darüber\nhin, bis das Werk zustande gekommen\nund die Wüste zum Ackerland gewor\nden war. das große Städte erstehen\nund blühen sah. Die Hartnäckigkeit\nund die Kraft des Menschen haben\nhier die Natur überwunden; aber bald\nkam die Zeit der moralischen und po\nlitischen Entartung, die alles verän\nderte. Als die menschliche Energie\nder Verweichlichung Platz machte,\ntrocknete der Boden wieder aus, und\nder Sand nahm vom Wasserlaufe\nBesitz. Unter dem Staubregen star\nben die Wunderstädte dahin und erst\nvor etwa fünfzig Jahren gelang cs\nden Archäologen, die versunkenen\nStädte von Ninive und Babylon wie\nner ans Licht des Tages zu bringen.\nDamit erwachte auch der Euphrat zu\nneucr Tätigkeit. Unzäh\'ige Ladun\ngen von Terrakotten und Statuen\nund Kunsttlümmern gelangten auf\nibm zur Verschiffung. Doch es war\nnur ein kurzes Eintagsleben. das dem\nfteiligen Strome betchieden war. Heute\ntiezt er wieder still, vergessen, und\nrüstet sich endgültig zum Sterben, aus\ndem es kein neues Erwachen gibt.\nf Nordileä or Sroiit, 81.\nNach Fort Bliß.\nSekretär Garrison ordnete die Hefter\nführunz der mexikanischen Sol\ndaten dorthin an.\nWashington.

Jan.\nSechs Generäle der mexikanischen\nBundesarmee, 3300 flüchtige Soldaten\nund 1500 flüchtige Civilisten, die letz\nten Samstag von General BiUa\'S Re\nbellentruppe aus Ojinaga, Mex„ ver\ntrieben wurden, mußten sich ain Mon\ntag auf einen vier bis sechs Tage\ndauernden Marsch vor: 67 Metten nach\nMarfa, Tex., vorbereiten. Die Sol\ndaten werden aus unbestimmte Zeit in\nFort Bliß untergebracht werden.

Tie Alttounfälle haben sich\nin der letzten Zeit derart gehäuft, daß\ndie Richter sich entschlossen haben, Haft\nftraftn an Stelle der Geldstrafe zu\nverhänge, um dem Uedelstand abzu\nhelfen.\nD.u iruM und Mcr.\nProfessor Metschnikow Arbeitet, wie\nbekann\', im Pariser Pasteurinstftrit\nseit langem daran, die Ursachen des\nfrühzeitigen Alterns zu ergründen.\nDie Beobachtung, daß die Lebens\nlange der Tiere im umgekehrten Ver\nhältnis zu der Länge ihres Dickdarms\nsteht, führt Metschnikow zu der Ver\nmutung, daß die im Darm vegetieren\nden Bakterien an dem vorzeitigen Ver\nfall unseres Organismus die Schuld\ntragen. Die von diesen Mikroben\nproduzierten Gifte sollen die Ursache\nunseres kurzen Lebens und der\nKrankheit unseres Alters sein. Tier\nversuche ergaben Degenerations-Er\nscheinungen und sogar Tötung der\nTiere durch solche Darmgifte. Zum\nBeispiel verursacht das Indol, ein\nProdukt der Darmfäulnis, das als\nlangsam wirkendes Gift die bekannten\nAkterserscheinungen hervorruft, vor\nallem die Arteriosklerose, die chronische\nEntzündung der Nieren, kurzum Er\nscheinungen, die für den im Alter ein\ntretenden Verfall charakteristisch sind.\nMetschnikow schlug zuerst, um die\nProduktion solcher Gifte in unserem\nDarm und damit die Altersdegenera\ntion zu bekämpfen, vor. Milchsäure\nbakterien zu verspeisen, da Säure den\nFäulnisprozeß hindert. Diese brau\nchen aber einen zuckerhaltigen Nähr\nboden. Nun dringt der mit der Nah\nrung ansgenommene Zucker nur höchst\nselten dis in die unteren Darmpar\ntien, und die Milchsäurebakterien ver\nmögen daher gerade an der wichtigsten\nStelle den Kampf gegen die Fäulnis\nbakterien nicht aufzunehmen. Es\nmußte danach, wie die „Naturwissen\nschaftliche Wochenschrift" berichtet,\nversucht werden, eine Produktions\nquelle von Zuckerstoff im Dickdarm\nselbst zu finden. In der Tat konnte\nein Darmbakterium ermittelt wer\nden, das Zucker aus Stärke bildet,\nohne die Eiweißkörper anzugreifen.\nDas zuckerbildende Bakterium paßte\nsich den Verhältnissen im menschlichen\nDarm überaus aut an und erwies\nsich absolut unschädlich, und di In\ndol- und Phenolbildung im Darm\nwurde sowohl bei Tieren wie bei\nMenschen bedeutend herabgesetzt. Zur\nUnterstützung der Wirkung empfiehlt\nes sich. Kartoffeln in jeder Zuberei\ntung zu essen. Außerdem ist es not\nwendig. den Fleiscbgenuß soweit wie\nmöalich einzus ranken. Das zucker\nbildende Bakterium lüdet den denkbar\nbc\'\'en Nährboden für das Wachstum\nund die Anffcd\'.nng der Müchffä\'. rQ:k\nterien im Darm. und erst im Zumm\nmcnwirken bien:\',:; erzielt man die\nvolle Wirkung.\nBcrMlicitcr-ft>iuct\nI\nIceue kosincoittraktc sind die l>aupl\naufgabe der Nniked INine I\'Oor\nkers os America.\nIndianapolis, Jnd., 18.

Wie viele wissen aber, was\ndieses Wort eigenNich bedeutet? so\nfragt Adolf Stöbet in einem hübschen\nAufsätze über Volksetymologie, Und\ndoch hat Jeder, der darüber mit un\ntergeschlagenen Armen nachsinnt, im\nwahrsten Sinne des Wortes die\nBretzel vor sich, denn sic ist nichts an\nderes als eine Nachbildung seiner un\nterschlagenen Arme, freilich imKleinen.\nDenn sonst würde sie Bretze heißen.\nBretze ist nach Jakob Grimm „ein in\nGestalt untergeschlagener Arme ge\nbackener Brotring und Bretzel die Ver\nkleinerungsform. Dies Wort ist aber\nnicht urdeutsch, sondern es kam zu uns\naus Italien, und hängt mit dem\nitalienischen „braccio" zusammen."\nDie Italiener nannten nun dieses\nnach beiden Armen geformte Gebäck\nmit dem Plural „bracci", und daraue\nentwickelte sich das deutsche Bretze-\nGebäck. von dem nur noch das Dimi\nuulivum Bretzel erhalten geblieben ist\nEine unverkennbare Verwandtschaft\nhat die Bretzel, die gewiß Verhältniß\nmäßig jungen Ursprunges ist, mb\neinem einfacheren und viel älteren Ge\nbäck, das von seiner Gestalt her einer,\nurdeutschen Namen trägt. Es bilde!\neinen Kreis, einen Ring, und heißt\ndeshalb Ring oder Kring, woraus\ndann genau wie bei der Bretzel die\nBerkleinerungssorm Kringel sich bil\ndete. Ter „Kring" als Gebäck ist\naber noch nicht lange ausgestorben.\nNochum 1780 schrieb z. B, Merck aus\nDarmstadt an Goethe: „Meine Frau\nläßt schon einen Pfingstkringen mehr\nfür Sie backen", und in dem 1865\nerschienen „Namenbüchlein" von Vil\nmar erscheint sogar noch der „Rinken\nbäckcr", der die „Riim-" macht. Es\nist sehr begreiflich, daß sich erst in\nverhälinißmäßig später Zeit die Di\nminutivformen zur Bezeichnung der\nGebäcke herausgebildet haben. Denn\ndie ältest.n Gebäcke zeigten sicherlich,\nwie die einfachste Gestalt, so auch ein\ngroßes Maß; erst später sind sie dann\nkle.n und in der Form künstlich ge\n! vordem\nCrosse.

At Kumamoto, north of\nKagoshima, are more than 1,000 refu\ngees. The whole tragedy has not yet\nbwn told.\nThe city of Tokio and surrounding\nterritory, although 500 miles from the\nroictuiic disturbances, were swept in\nthe last 24 hours by miniature torna\ndoea. filling the city with clouds of\ndust and sand and creating the belief\nthat the capital was feeling the effects\nof the distant eruptions. A feeling of\nrelief prevailed at night when the\nwind died down.\nSakura. where the greatest loss of\nlife undoubtedly occurred, cannot be\nvisited, because the eruptions of Sa\nkura-Jima continues.

NEWS\n. ATTENDANCE AND TARDINESS.\nAs has been reported in this column\nbefore, the record of attendance and\ntardiness iu Lancaster is probably\nvery much better than in most places\nin the state. And yet in Lancaster\nihere are a large number of cases that\nare not entirely necessary. In the\ncase of tardiness, especially in the\ngiades, great care ought to be taken\nby parents to get children started in\ntune and to urge upon them the\nnecessity of being on time. Lately\nat the North school the tardines-i has\nbeen quite general, many being from\nfive to tbiity minutes late, and all\nwithout good reason. The pupils who\nare tardy most often are those who\ncould have reached the school on time\nif they had made an effort The\nteachers have tried to correct the\nmatter, but the co-operation of the\nparents is needed to secure results.\nA child who is reared to come and go\nat his will, will become the victim\nof a tendecy that does much to injure\nhis poseibe success.\nA summary of the records in the\nhigh school shows that for the first\nfour months of the year, thirty pupils\nbave neither been absent nor tardy.\nOf these seven are boys; the best\npercentage of attendance ie in tbe\nFreshman class, wtich out of a\npresent enrollment of thiry-seven has\nfourteen without any loss of time.\nTHE HIGH SCHOOL EXAMINATIONS.\nOn Thursday and Friday. Jan. 22\nand 23, the final semester examina\ntions in the highschool will be held\nThose who have been doing their\ndaily work faithfully bave nothing to\nfear from these tests, but for others\ntbe finals may spell failure, as they\ncount one-fourth with the daily work\nand the monthly tests for tbe\ndetermination of the final average.\nAny pupil who falls below 65 in\neither his tests or his daily work or\nwhose average of test and daily work\nis below 75, fails in his work for the\nsemester and must take the subject\nagain. To seniors, therefore, it is a\nmatcter of graduation.\nA new plan for rbetorical work in\nthe high school was explained to tbe\nstudents last Friday. For tbe second\nsemester of the year, all the pupils in\ntbe school are to be divided into\nfive classes, each of which is to be in\ncharge of a teacher. These divisions\nwill meet separately once each week\nfor their work in public speaking.\nThe same rules will apply to this\ndepartment of work that govern every\nether subject in the school; pupils\nmust attend their division regularly\nand must do their work thoroughly\nand satisfactorily, for records are to\nbe kept, and failure in rhetoricals\nwill prevent graduation just as in any\nother subject.\nFor the seniors the work will con\nsist largely of writing and speaking\ntheir orations; in the other classes,\nit will be the recitation of declama\ntions, debates, extempore speeches,\nand other forms of address.\nRegular drill is to begin next week.\nMr. Frank Meyer spoke before the\nhigh school assembly last Wednesday\nmorning on lack of interest that the\npupils showed in their activities.\nHe condemned tbe attitude of boys\nand girls in school who expected\neverything to be done for them rather\nthan do for themselves, and who com\nplained because opportunities were\nnot furnished them for amusement\nHe recommended strongly that pupils\nget interested in things, and that\nthrough that interest, they get for\nthemselves the things they think they\nought to have.\nFORTY-ONE MILLION\nTO PAY ALL TAXES.\nWisconsin Tax Commission Completes\nTabulation Showing Enormous\nSize of Tax Budget.\nMadison, Wis.—The state tax\ncommission announced today tbe re\nsults of tabulations of Wisconsin\ntaxes for 1914.

Tbe\ntotal assessed valuation last year was\n$2,841,630,416, tbe total taxes $33,-\n623,412,919, and the tax rate\n.01183243701. This increase is slight\nly more than two mills, equivalent to\n$2.04 for sl,o’oo of true valuation.\nAn interesting observation in this\nconnection is the fact that the IN\nCREASE in taxes of all kinds this\nyear is greater than tbe TOTAL\namount of taxes paid for the year 1879\n—an interval of 35 years.\nSEVEN TOWNS APPEAL\nTO TAX COMMISSION\nAre Not Satisfied With The Equaliza\ntion Values Made by the\nCounty Board\nThe town of Clifton filed an appeal\nMonday from tbe equalization figures\nreported for tbat town, including tbe\nvillage of Livingston, by tbe equaliza\ntion committee of tbe county board.\nThis makes a total of seven towns in\ntbe county that have so appealed, the\nothers being Marion, Castle Rock,\nBoscobel.

The postoffice officials hold\nthat no dead sis hor game which has\nbeen killed illegally may be sent\nthrough tbe mails and tbat tbe laws\nof the state specify tbat postmasters\nshall not accept for mailing any\nparcel containing tbe dead bodies or\nparts thereof any wild animals which\nhave been offered for shipment in\nviolation of the laws of the state ter\nritory or district in which they were\nkilled. Provided, however that the\nforegoing shall not be construed to\nprevent tbe acceptance for mailing of\nany dead animals or birds killed dur\ning tbe season when tbe same may be\nlawfully captured.\nIt was also stated tbat tbe postoffice\nauthorities have the right to inspect\nall parcels placed in their care for\ntransportation, and when tbe packages\nare found to contain dead fish or\ngame shipped out of season, steps for\nthe punishment of the offender can be\nstarted under the federal laws.\nStock Shipments.\nWednesday—J.

I don't claim\nany “state championship. ’ This was\na connty competition. However. I\nunderstand that my record, 133 bushels\nand 38 pounds of corn produced on one\nacre, is the best production of any\nofficially observed. The best previous\nrecord was 13 bushels and 39 pounds\nless than mine.\n[ live in the Town of Eden, and\nwhile we call this “God’s country,”\nthere are many other localities in\nWisconsin, where with similar condi\ntions and equally good seed and care,\nperhaps fully as large yields would\nresult. We had 195 competitors in\nour contest and the general average\nwas so high as to demonstrate the\nwisdom of planting corn in Wiscon\nsin, and more to tbe point tbe wisdom\nof careful selection of seed and giv\ning tbe field tne best possible care.\nMy seed was the Golden Glow variety,\nNo. 12, pure bred. I obtained it from\nJ. P. Bonzelet, and it came from the\nuniversity of Wisconsin Experiment\nstation in 1907. It was planted on\nunusually good clay loam, brought to\na high state of fertility by rotation of\ncrops.\nI selected an acre on the outside of\na forty acre field of corn, and kept\nbusy. Throughout the season I paid\nstrictest attention to the corn, weed\ning it carefully, hill by bill, hoeing\nit by band and also cultivating it\nwith a team plow. The plants never\nstopped growing until sjme of them\nattained a height of ten feet, but\nmany of tbe stalks that made good\nwars were only five feet in height.\nWhen the grain was mature I got the\ncrop into barn in good weather and\ndid tbe husking by hand. I consider\ntbe final results ample reward for tbe\nadditional labor spent over tbe amount\ntne ordinary field gets for I figure the\naverage cost of this corn at only 10*£\ncents a bushel.\nThis experiment convinces me that\nscientific farming is the only proper\nway to get the best respite; 1 have not\nsold tbe crop but it is worth in tbe\nneighborhood of SIOO or $l5O, accord\ning to how much of it is sold as seed.\nThis particular lot is in demand by\nseedsmen simply because it won tbe\nprize, and possibly it will bring a\nhigher price for that reason, but any\n133 bushels of such high quality corn\nwould doubtless bring SIOO which is a\nrather good return on one acre of\nground and aboutsls worth of work.\nMilwaukee Journal.\n—The third anniversary of the\ndedication of the M.

Glass of\nAlabama is not to be seated to succeed\nthe late Senator Johnston, the senate\ncommittee on elections determined\nthat the seventeenth amendment is\nnow in full effect; that no supplement\nal legislation by legislatures is neces\nsary, and that the governor of a state\nhas authority to call a special election\nwhere machinery for such an election\nexists.\nThe senate will pass upon the cc.n\nmittee’s report today.\nIn the Maryland case one Republic\nan, Senator Kenyon of lowa, voted\nwith six Democratic members to seat\nMr. Lee. In the Alabama case only\nSenator Bradley, Republican, of Ken\ntucky, favored seating Mr. Glass. Dem\nocratic leaders expect opposition from\nthe Republican side before a vote is\nreached on the Maryland case.\n“The two cases.” said Chairman\nKern, “were vastly different. In the\nAlabama case proponents of Mr. Glass\nmaintained that the seventeenth\namendment was not in effect because\nthe legislature had not met to supple\nment it with machinery to carry it out\nand that therefore the old laws were\nin force. In the Maryland case, the\nvalidity of the amendment was recog\nnized and effort to carry it out through\nexisting election machinery, a course\nwhich was ratified by a majority of the\nvoters of the state. In Alabama, the\namendment was ignored and in Mary\nland it was sought to carry out the\nspirit of the amendment.”\nGlass was appointed by Governor\nO’Neal to fill the unexpired term of\nSenator Johnston, who died after the\ndirect elections amendment had be\ncome a part of the constitution.\nIn the Maryland case Governor\nGoldsborough called a primary elec\ntion and Blair Lee was victorious. In\nthis case it was declared that the elec\ntion was irregular because it had not\nbeen called by the legislature, but the\ncommittee held that Mr. Lee was en\ntitled to his seat because he was\nchosen by direct vote of the people.\nRelics of Wagner Stolen.\nRelics of Wagner, the great com\nposer, were stolen from the family\nhome, Villa Wahnfried. at Bayreuth,\nGermany, on a recent night.

Ground.\nPaper Written by Ernest Wichern, Son of Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Wichern\nand Read Before the Skillet Creek Farmers’ Club\nThere was clover on the bind laßt\nyear. The first crop was cut for hay\nand the second was cut for seed. The\nnext spring about twenty tons of\nstable manure were hauled on the land\nand plowed in the latter part of May.\nThe ground was harrowed and the\ncorn planted about the first of June*\nThe corn came up iu a few days and\nwfien it was about four inches high it\nwas dragged crosswise as the corn\nwas drilled in. After the corn was\nhigh enough to cultivate I went\nthrough it with the sulkey cultivator,\nthis being about the middle of June.\nAbout ten days later the com was\ngone through again with the same\ncultivator. A week after this we\nstarted hoeing it. The rows were\nplanted three feet, eight inches apart,\nand the corn was very thick in the\nrow. As we hoed it we thinned the\nstalks out to about twelve inches\napart. It took two or three weeks to\nget it all hoed because it seemed hard\nto stick to the job. It it had bsen hoed\nand thinned sooner there would have\nbsen a larger yield.\nThere was nothing done with the\ncorn after this until husking time£\nNumerous\nterritorial\nResidents\nDiscovered\nSince our last report several new\nnames have been added to the News\nTerritorial club.

After the stalks were knocked\ndown the chickens and little pigs\nfound that it was a good place to get\ntheir meals. The Saturday before the\nfair we husked the corn, allowing\nseventy five pounds to the bushel.\nThe corn yield of the country could\nbe greatly increased if the corn could\nbe taken care of in the right way and\nat the right time.\n(Editor\'s Note—ln the corn contest\nconducted by County Superintendent\nG. W. Davies, Walter Klip3tein of\nLoganville look first prize and Ernest\nWichern second. The average yield\nin the United States is 23 bushels,\nin Wisconsin 40 bushels and in the\ncontest 100.

Editor and Punisher.\nVALUABLE TOPIC FOR FARMER\nBUSINESS METH\nODS ON THE FARM\nEvery Up-to-date Farmer Should\nTake an Inventory of His\nFarm Now.\nThe Leader has adopted anew feature\nin its endeavor to be especially value\naide to the farmer and will each month\npublish p irts of the Wisconsin Bankers\nfarm bulletin, having been requested to\ndo so by the Farmers & Citizens Hank.\nThe for ming article on Inventories is\nan especially valuable one and should be\ncot out aud saved for reference.\nAn inventory is a statement showing\nin detail the value of land, buildings,\nlivestock, equipment, produce, cash on\nhand and in the bank on the date of in\nventory, together with the amounts of\nall notes and bills that others owe to the\nfarmer as well as those that the farmer\nowes others.\nWhy take an Inventory?\nAn inventory shows, lirst, the farmers\ntotal investment, second, his net worth,\nthird, how much his net worth has in\ncreased or decreased during the year.\nThe total investment is determined by\nadding together th e values of the various\nclasses of property. On this invest\nment the farm must pay a fair rate of\ninterest before there is any return for\nlabor. It is often desirable to know\nhow much of the total capital is invest\ned in horses, land, buildings, etc., and\nby a proper grouping of the farm prop\nerty the annual inventory will furnish\nthe most excellent material for such\nstudy. In case there are no debts, the\nnet worth will be the same as the total\ninvestment; but on farms where there\nare debts these must be subtracted\nfrom the total investment. By compar\ning the net worth of the inventory at\nthe beginning of the year and the net\nworth of that at the end of the year, the\nfarmer can see how much he has gone\nahead or dropped behind.\nBesides furnishing the farmer and his\nfamily a living, the increase or decrease\nin the net worth is what the farm has\ngiven in return for labor and the use of\ncapital. To be able to determine how\nmuch one has gained or lost during the\nyear is of great importance, and the\nvalue of the information alone will more\nthan repay the farmer for the time\nspent on the inventory. It is a common\nmistake for all those who do not take\nthe inventory to look at the amount of\navailable cash as a guage of their busi\nness success. This is a grievious mis\ntake for fluctuations in cash mean prac\ntically nothing. A gain of SI,OOO in cash\nat the end of the year may simply mean\nthat some of the property on hand last\nyear has been turned into cash. On the\nother hand, a decrease of 11,000 may\nmean that what was cash last year ap\npears now in the form of anew build\ning or some other improvement.\nAn annual inventory will also be of\nmaterial assistance in adjusting a loss\nby fire-should buildings, or contents,\nbe burned.\nTime of Taking Inventory.\nFor Wisconsin the time of taking an\ninventory will vary between January 1\nand April 1, preferably March 1. The\nexact date will depend on the location\nof the farm and the type of farming.\nOn a poultry farm the most convenient\ndate is in the fall; whereas on dairy and\nstock farms where there is likely to be\na great deal of feed on hand earlier in\nthe year it might be advisable to post\npone this work until later in the winter.\nFor best results ihe inventories ought\nto be taken on the same date each year,\nand, hence, it is advis: ble to choose a\ndate that is early enough to make it\npossible to get this work done before\nfield work begins even during the years\nof early spring.\nBuildings,\nList and give a valuation to each\nbuilding - The value to be put upon a\nbuilding will depend upon its present\nusefulness, original cost, character of\nbuilding material used, construction,\nstate of repair, age, location, etc. In\ncase of dwellings and barns, handiness\nand sanitation are also points which need\nto be considered. The value must be\nestimated on the basis of the above\nfactors. Statistics show that buildings\nwill, as a rule, decrease in value at a\nyearly rate of from two to four per cent\nof the original cost.\nWater System.\nUnder this heading enter all items\nthat have to do with the water supply\nof the farm and that is a part of real\nestate. Gasoline engines and movable\ntanks would not be included in this\ngroup. Pumps, welis, cement tanks\nand reservoirs, windmills, etc., should\nbe itemized and given separate values.\nThe values of windmills and pumps\nmust be reduced at the rate of from six\nto ten per cent yearly, whereas, wells,\nconcrete tanks and reservoirs can be\nput in the inventory at the same value\neach year.\nLand.\nAfter having obtained the value of\nbuildings and the water system, add the\ntwo totals together and subtract their\nCbe iUatmown meekly Header\nsum from the value of the whole farm.\nThe remainder will be the value of the\nland including fences, woodlots and\ndrainage. Land ought to be left at the\nsame value in the inventory from year\nto year unless there is good reason for\nsome other practice.\nLive Stock.\nHorses and cattle are inventoried in\ndividually. In order that they may be\nrecognized when taking the next in\nventory, they ought to be listed either\nby name or number. The local selling\nprice of horses and cows will help to\ndetermine their value. Age must be\nconsidered. Horses usually rise in\nvalue until the y are about 4 years old\nand then fluctuate with the seasonal\nprice until they are about 10, and then\ndrop off rather rapidly. The value of\nmilk cows will usually rise and fall in\nthe same manner. Hogs, sheep, poultry,\n(unless purebred), are usually inven\ntoried at a certain rate per head, this\nrate being based on market price.\nProduce and Supplies.\nThis includes, hay, straw, grains, corn,\nground feed, binder twine, paints, oils,\nnails, posts, etc. Most of the puchased\nsupplies are on hand in small quantities\nand can either be weighed or estimated.\nWith roughage, grains and corn it is\ndifferent. The amounts on hand of\nthese commodities are found by getting\nthe cubic contents of the bins, mows,\nand stacks. To find the approximate\nnumber of cubic feet in a stack, measure\nits length, width and “over.” To meas\nure the “over,” throw the tape over the\nstack and hold it tight down to the bot\ntom of the stack on both sides. Having\nthe measurement, multiply the length\nby the width, by the “over” and divide\nby 4 to get the number of cubic feet.\nThe number of cubic feet to a ton will\nvary from 320 to 550, depending on the\nkind of hay and how well it is packed.\n500 is ordinarily a safe figure to use.\nEar corn will run between 2y% and 2 l / 2\ncubic feet per bushel, depending some\nwhat on the size of the ears and the\nlength of time it has been in the crib.\nIf one wishes to use 2% cubic feet, the\neasiest method is to multiply by 4 and\ndivide by 10. A bushel of oats, barley,\netc., runs very close to 1 l / 2 cubic feet\nto the bushel. To reduce cubic feet to\nbushel, therefore, one may either divide\nby or else multiply the cubic con\ntents of the bin by 8 and divide by 10.\nSilage will vary from 20 to 60 po mds\nto the cubic foot, depending chiefly on\nthe height to which the silage stood in\nthe silo at the time of filling. There is\nno market price for silage, but for the\npurpose of the inventory it may be\nvalued at 1 3 the market price of hay.\nMachinery and Equipment.\nFor best results, list and value each\nmachine and tool by itself. If one does\nnot desire such detail, minor equipment\ncan be listed and valued in smaller\ngroups, as for instance, carpenter’s\ntools, b\'acksmith’s tools and garden\ntools. But no matter which method is\nused in inventorying minor equipment,\nit is always advisable at the time of tak\ning the first inventory to make a com\nplete list of all tools. For later inven\ntories the value of such equipment may\nbe determined by subtracting 10 per\ncent from the value of the preceding\ninventories and adding the value of new\ntools. At just what value to put ma\nchinery into an inventory will depend\non cost, age, usefulness and efficiency.\nA cinder that cuts 20 acres will last\nlonger than the one cutting 100 acres a\nyear. A machine stored indoors while\nnot used will last longer tnan the one\nleft outdoors, etc. The inventions of\nnew and more efficient machines may\ncause sudden drops in the values of the\nold machinery. As soon as the binder\nwas put on the market the value of the\nreaper was decreased rapidly. Special\ncrop machinery will decrease in value\nsuddenly in case the growing of that\ncrop is discontinued. An example of\nthis would be the sugar beet equipment\nin localities where the growing of beets\nhas been discontinued. The average\nrate at which machinery will decrease\nis not always of much use, but may\nserve as guides. The following are\nsome of the annual rates of deprecia\ntion for the more common machines:\nper cent.\nHay rakes, grain binders, mowers.. . 8\nDrills and seeders, corn planters, corn\ncultivators, gang plows. 7\nHay loaders, manure spreaders 12\nWalking plows and heavy harness... 6\nHarrows 9\nWagons and disks 5\nCash and Notes.\nCash on hand aud in the bank, as well\nas all notes and bills that the farm busi\nness has coming from others, should be\ndetermined aud inventoried accurately.\nBy depositing in a bank proceeds of all\nproduce aud stock sold, and payment of\nall bills bv bank cheek, the annual “pro\nfit or loss” may be more easily ascertain\ned aud annual inventories more readily\nprepared.\nDebts.\nAll debts should be included in the in\nventory. It is advisable to list each\nmortgage ana note and bill separately,\nand to give the name of the party to\nwhom it is drawn.\nValuation.\nThe chief aim in taking an inventory\nshould be to make it show the actual con-\nditions of the farm business. In order\nto make the inventory show this it is\nnecessary to be conservative in all valua\ntions. To be able to place an exact\nvalue on the different items of farm\nproperty is, of course, difficult, but for\ntunately this is not absolutely necessary\nfor the accuracy of the inventory as a\nwhole will not vary directly with the\ncorrectness of the valuation of any one\nitem. If one acquaints himself with\ncurrent prices and tries to be fair in\nhis estimate he is not likely to be very\nfar off on the value of any one item,\nand what mistakes he may make wil\nmost likely offset one another. In case\nof the herd he may rate some of his cows\na little high, but he is just as apt to\nvalue other cows a little too low, and\nthe chances are that by adding together\nall of the values his result would be very\nclose to what the herd would sell for.\nK.

WIS„ JANUARY 23. 1914-\nCITY ATTORNEY\nREPORTS SUITS\nStales Outcome ci Boughner and\nLewis Fund Cases at\nCouncil Meeting\nThe following report was given at a\nregular meeting of the city council by\nCity Attorney Gustav Buchheit:\nTo the Common Council of the City of\nWatertown, Wis.\nGentlemen: It is ray duty to report to\nyou at this time the outcome of the two\nof our most important lawsuits, namel>:\nthe one relating to the Fannie P. Lewis\nPark Fund and the case of Helen C.\nBoughner, against the city. The former\ncase involved purely questions of law,\nand Judge Grimm has seen fit to decide\nagainst the contention of the city. In\nthe Boughner case the jury, in Judge\nLueck’s court, rendered a special verdict,\nwhich evidently was based on nothing\nbut sympathy for the plaintiff, who it\nappears is crippled and in destitute cir\ncumstances. I fail to find any evidence\nto establish the alleged fact that the ice\nand snow upon which the plaintiff fell,\nexisted for three weeks prior to the ac\ncident, which under the law must be\naffirmatively shown by the plaintiff be\nfore she can recover. Consequently it is\nmy advice that both of these cases be\ntaken to our supreme court, in justice\nto the taxpayers. Both cses present\nnew questions and the secondary liabil\nity, if there is any, of the Barker Lumber\nand Fuel company can be ascertained in\nno other way, having reference, of course,\nonly to the Boughner case. The additional\ncosts in both these cases, if the city lost\nin the supremo court, would be about\none hundred dollars. Besides the afore\nsaid .castes the cases of Mrs. Schroeder,\nMrs. Polzin and the midnight tresspass\ners may come on for trial next month,\nand in order to provide for the advance\nwitness fees, etc., which may be required\nin such event, and to provide for the\nsupreme court’s clerk fees, in the above\ncases, which I shall appeal, I hereby ask\nyou to appropriate the sum of $75.00.\nRespectfully yours,\nGustav Buchheit,\nCity Attorney.\nStale Feeble Minded Home\nQuito a number of merchants are in\nterested in the fact that the State may\nbuild a home for the feeble minded here,\nnorthwest of the city limits.

It is an actual and\nstupendous condition that faces, aud\nthreatens to outface, the small town and\nthe countryside. A recent report of our\nResearch Bureau establishes that the\nmail order houses carry on annually\ntwenty per cent, as much business as\nthat done by the country merchants of\nthe nation. In other words for every\ndollar spent by the rural consuming\npublic, the town or community, or sec\ntion is taxed twenty cejits. It is virtu\nally a tax on the general resources, since\nthe endless chain element is missing.\nNot a cent of .his money comes back to\nthe spender or to any other member of\nthe community, as does a goodly share\nof all the money spent with the local\ndealer. It is aa economic fact that every\nmail order purchase by a citizen marks\na blow at the prosperity of the com\nmunity.”\nOne feature of the League’s education\nal campaign, according to the statement,\nwill be a through presentation of figures\naiming to show that “mail order bargains\nare, in very many cases, such in name\nonly.” On this point, Mr. Whittier says:\n“Aside from the social phase is the con\nstantly increasing evidence that the con\nsumer, in perhaps a majority of cases,\ncan trade at home and actually save\nmoney on the yeai’s purchases.’’\nBEE-KEEPERS\'\nCONVENTION\nWill Be Held At Madison Tuesday\nand Wednesday.

Next we will look at how we can use the metadata from our results to build a query that use the API to get OCR text from one of the newspaper pages. 

The first four key value pairs in the dictionary object tell us about the results of our query, but the fifth one, with the key 'items' is the one that gives us the bulk of the metadata about the newspapers that meet our requirements. To build our query, we need to grab the id so that we can add it to our URL. We could either manually grab it from our text file or we can call it using its index in the list. 


```python
#Deal with dictionaries within lists

He had not been\nin ill health. His son Frank died but\nthree weeks ago leaving a void in the\nmusical circle of the city, he having\nbeen for years director of the city’s\nwidely known Marine Band. Frank,\nSr., was born in Hungary in 1854 and\ncame to this country in the early 00’s\nand had lived in Maple Grove until 3\nyears ago. He was a man of good char\nacter and esteemed by all his neigh\nbors.

Grace\nand Intelligence, and Especially\nRadiance.\nWhat can a young girl, who Is net\nther a great beauty nor a great heir\ness, nor one to whom the gods stood\nsponsor at birth, do to make herself\npopular?\nLet us sit down and take our chins\nIn our hands and think about It\nA girl must have, at least In some\nsmall degree, four qualities. There\nare children of fortune who have them\nall, and in abundance, but as from a\nsmall palette of primary colors a great\npicture may be painted, just so out\nof a few elementary attributes quite\nwonderful results are possible. The\nfour qualities of personality are:\nBeauty, grace, intelligence, radk\nance.\nBeauty may be that of face or fig\nure, oAAt may be merely an effort of\nbeauty through style, charm, or even\none of the other three qualities fol\nlowing:\nGrace includes not alone symmetrj\nof movement, but all accomplish\nments In activity, such a a dancing,\nskating, swimming, riding, and also\nany especial gifts, such as a talent for\nmusic or acting. In other words, the\ngirl who has the "gift of grace” in the\ngirl who does things well.\nBy intelligence is meant the sympa\nthetic, adaptable quality of mind, rath\ner than that of the brilliant order. Hut\nthe one great attribute that crowns\nthem all —granting, of course, some\ngift of the other three—but without\nwhich beauty, grace, cleverness are\nall as applet of Sodom—is the sense\nof enjoyment, the gift of happiness.\n1 dot t think 1 can better define it\nthan by tbe word radiance. And best\nof all, radiance is a quality that can\nb( cultivated.\nBeards in Olden Times.\nThe Greeks wore their beards until\nthe time of Alexander, but that great\ngeneral, probably remembering an en\ncounter with bis wife, orderd the Mace\ndonians to be shaved, lest their beards\nshould g_lve a handle to their enemies.\nHeards were worn by the Romans In\n390 I), C.

They cannot\nreason wrong, for tuey do not reason\nat all. They have fewer pretensions,\nare less Implicated In theories, and\njudge of objects more from their im\nmediate and involuntary Impression\non the mind, and therefore more truly\nand naturally.— Hail\'tt.\nMANITOWOC, WIS., THURSDAY, JANUARY I. 1314.\nITEMS FROM THE PILOT FILES.\nFIFTY YEARS AGO.\nThe Fortunes of War.—-A soldier\nof the 17th regulars, a native of Phila\ndelphia, at the battle of Chickamauga\nwas struck with a piece of shell in the\nright eye, then passing under the\nbridge of the nose destroying the sight\nof the left eye, and he is now perfectly\nblind, though in the prime of life. In\nthe same action in which he lost bis\neyesight, he had a father and three\nbrothers killed leaving out of a whole\nfamily only himself and his aged moth\ner.\nAfter Them. —General Grant has\ncaptured, within the past seven months,\nfour hundred and twelve cannons,\nnamely: fifty-two on his advance to\nVicksburg, three hundred at that place\nand sixty last week before Chattanoo\nga. Two thousand United Stales can\nnons were stolen from Norfolk at the\nbeginning of the rebellion, but if Grant\nkeeps on at this : ate he will soon get\nthem all back again.

He be\nlieved himself forced to run first, or be\nwhipped and then run. Doubtless the\nconclusion was well grounded.\nNow here we are again—flat on our\nbacks; without force enough to con\nquer another square rod of southern\nterritory.

A couple\nof weeks ago the three started out in the\ncountry for a longer walk than usual.\nThey took the railroad track until they\nhad gone as far as they wished and\nthen made for a country mail on which\nthey proposed home. ’ After\ntramping an hour they thought they\nshould be in sight of the city but could\ndiscover no trace of Manitowoc. They\nipuckened their pace for an other half\nhour and still could discover no trace\nof the lost city. Peers thought some\none had run away with the pjace; Sas\nse thought there was some witchcraft\nabout the thing and Levereni’. proposed\nthey camp out and wait for a relief ex\npedition. A farmer passed by and the\nthree hailed him with. "Say, where’s\nManitowoc’?” The farmer thought\nthey were guying him and wanted to\nlight the crowd. Hasse thought it\nwould be a good plan to mount\nand holler as they used to do In olden\ntime w hen lost in the woods in hope\nthat someone in the city would hear\nand give an answering shout. Their\nqueer maneuvers made the farmers\nsuspicious and when one of the crowd\nwould approach a house to inquire\nabout Manitowoc, lie would he chased\nout of the yard with dogs. Peers went\ninto the woods having heard at one\ntime that persons lost could find ttieir\nway homo by noticing on which side of\nthe tree the moss grew. Put it was as\nhard to find moss as it was to lind the\ncity. In the meantime the farmers\nwere collecting with pitchforks, hoes\nand axes to drive away the three dan\ngerous looking characters who pre\ntended they did not know the way to\nManitowoc. The trio set olf on a run\nand took anew road. They reached\nthe Pranch village by nightfall but\ndidn’t know the place. One of them\ninsisted it was Amigo and that there\nwere a few people there who know\nhim. Another thought it was Hurley\nas they walked far enough to reach\nthat place. The third thought it was\nDepere and pointed to the river as\nproof. They came near having a row\nover the matter but in the nick of\nlime a man approached whom they\nknew. Py round about questions they\nlesrned where they were and hired a\nman to lake them home.\nNow when they go outside the city\nlimits for a walk one of ’em walks\nbackwards so as to keep the city from\ngetting awry from them. People who\nmeet them wonder why one fellow pre\nfers to walk backward, but the oilier\ni wo explain that he wras born that way.\nThey take turns in this task and never\nget beyond sight of the city.\nEDUCATIONAL.\n(ByC.

It is the purpose\nof the State Hoard to hold such rallies\nin every county before the next meet\ning of the legislature. The State\nBoard of Education is especially anxi\nous to create sentiment which will re\nsult in favorable action Ity the Slate\nlegislature on the following mo.-suies;\n1. An increased State appropriation\nfor common schools.\n2. A Slate supervisor of rural\nschools ns an assistant to the State Su\nperindent of Public Instruction.\n3.

Most of these young people have\ncompleted the work of the elementary\nschools. The schools are located in\nthecountry and are intended primarl\'y\nfor country youth. The sciences con\nnected with agriculture are taught,\nbut the greatest emphasis is laid on\nhistory, biography, and literature.\nThe schools then are not vocational\nschools except in a very broad sense.\nThe great object is to awaken the\nintellectual life of the students, lo\nmake them ambitious to live efficient\nly and nobly, and to teach them how\nthis may be accomplished.\nIt is said that 10 per cent of the pop\nulation of Denmark goes through these\nschools. Their popularity is attested\nby the fact that they are supported by\ncooperative effort of the people them\nselves; only very small annual grants\nare received from the government.\n’[’he Folk High Schools are a mighty\nagency :n the life not only of the rural\ncommunities hut of the nation at large.\nFive members of the Denmark cabinet\narc from the Folk High Schools, four\nof these are farmers. Many members\nof the lower house of parliament are\nalso from these schools. Eighty per\ncent of the officials and managers in\nthe cooperative agricultural societies\nand enterprises have attended Folk\nHigh Schools.\nThe results achieved hy these schools\nare a good example of the remarkable\nresults which can lie achieved when\nthe people are given the kind of educa\ntion which they really need.\nDISEASES OF SCftOOLCHILDREN.\nTuhercu\'osis of the lungs is the lead\ning cause of deaths among American\nchildren during the period of school\nlife, Next in order ere incidents,\nO.TORRISON COMPANY\nTATE Extend to All Our\n* * Best Wishes for a\nProsperous and Happy New\nYear and Wish to Thank\nYou for the share of patron\nage with which you have\nfavored us ...\nWe are now in the midst of our\nannual inventory taking and\nbeginning with January 2nd you\nwill find throughout the entire\nstore unusual bargains priced so\nlow that if money-saving is the\nobject you should look through\nthe different departments . .\nO.

Way, vice president\nand manager of the electrical depart\nment of the company has been busy\nworking out the proposition for several\nweeks and he will come to Kenosha on\nMonday ready to submit his figures.\nNo indication as to the amount to be\nasked for the lights has been allowed\nto creep out of the offices of the com\npany and the proposition will be a\ncomplete surprise to the members of\nthe council. The company has made a\nformal petition to the mayor asking\nthat the hours for lighting in Kenosha\nbe changed. The suggestion is that the\nlights be started eight minutes earlier\nin the eveniug and turned off eight min\nutes earlier in the morning. This will\nmake the schedule in Kenosha conform,\nwith tne\'s* 1 nodule now in use in other\ncities in the state. It is probable that\nthe council will give its sanction to the\nchange in the schedule.\nMARRIED AT FOND DU LAC.\nMiss Grace Morris Becomes Bride of\nTheodore Hettrick Today.\nA wedding of great interest to many\nKenosha people was celebrated at St.\nJoseph church at Fond du Lac this\nmorning w\'hen Miss Grace Morris,\ndaughter of Mr. and Mrs. C.

The machine room will be\none story, 85x120 feet, and adjoining it\nwill be four new dry kilns. These kilns\nwill be each 18x120 feet in size. The\ncompany installed its present kilns\nseven years ago but the system now in\nuse has become antiquated and the\nplans for the coming year provide for\nthe installation of the latest kilns of\nthe Morton company. These, when com\npleted, will give the. company a capac\nity of 40,000 feet of dry lumber daily.\nThe next building will be a new power\nplant and this plant will provide for a\nchange from steam to electric power.\nIt is the plan cf the company to change\nover the pqwer of the entire plant as\nrapidly as possible and electric units of\nthe most modern kind will be installed.\nAnother building is a glue room which\nwill be used for veneering. This build\ning will be two stories in height and\n60x220 feet. With this space the busi\nness of the company may be greatly\nenlarged. The last building in the new\nplans is a great storage warehouse two\nstories in height and 60x122 feet in\nsize.\n“We are planning to double the ca\npacity of the plant,” said L. T. Han\nnahs m discussing the plans of the\ncompany this morning. “We appre\nciate that this building work will take\nsome time but we expect to rush the\noperations as much as possible. Growth\nof the business along many lines has\nmade necessary these big additions to\nthe plant. We desire to take care of\nthe business in the best possible man\nner and in order to keep abreast of the\ngrowing business a very large increase\nin capacity has been demanded.”\nThe Hannahs company has been\ngrowing by leaps and bounds in the\npast few years and the plant is now\none of the largest of the kind in the\ncountry. Its growth lias been a matter\nof especial interest to the people of\nKenosha on account of the fact that it\nhas been the product of local brains and\nlocal capital. The company hopes to\ncomplete all of the new buildings\nplanned by the end of 1914. Of course\nthis large increase in the size of the\nplant will bring a corresponding in\ncrease in the number of men to be em\nployed by the company. The company\nhas in recent months purchased land as\nsites for the new buildings and no fur\nther land will be required to carry out\nthe plans.\nMARRIED AT WAUKEGAN.\nNels Nelson and Katherine Ryan Have\nTrouble Fighting Railway Conductors.\nThere was a Kenosha wedding at\nWaukegan on Tuesday afternoon when\nMiss Katherine Ryan and Nels Kelson,\nboth well known among the young peo\nple of Kenosha, were married at the\nparsonage of one of the Waukegan\nchurches. The wedding was not with\nout a feature as the bride and groom\nhad considerable trouble having their\nwishes carried out. They had planned\nto be married by a minister who had\nofficiated at a wedding of the bride’s\nsister a year ago, but when they reach\ned Waukegan they were besieged by\nconductors on the street ears who were\nseeking marriage business for one of\nthe Waukegan justices.

It has been a year of joy and\nsorrow in Kenosha and it has brought\nits blessings and its pains. The year\nhas not been a notable one along any\nlines and there have been few great\nevents to make it stand out prominent\nly in the history of the city. Regarded\nas a hoo-doo year from the start peo\nple have dreaded the coming of calami\nties, yet few years have found less as\ncidents in Kenosha. There have, of\ncourse, been shadows in many hearts,\nbut these have been counterbalanced\nby joys in the hearts of others. The\ndeath rate in Kenosha during the year\nhas been a normal one. The city has\nbeen free from any serious scourge of\ncontagious disease, this being in\nstrange contrast to the preceding year.\nThere has been an unusually large\namount of crime in the city during the\ntwelve months and the courts have been\ncorrespondingly busy.\nIn the affairs of the municipality the\nyear has been one of many accomplish\nments. There has been large extensions\nof the paving and sewer systems of the\ncity. Much has been done along lines\nof systematizing the affairs of the var\nious departments and commissions un\nder city rule. The old trunk sewer\nclaim bogey laid over to 1913 by the\nformer year has been dispose! of in a\nmanner favorable to the city and fair\nto the contractors. Ashland avenue has\nbeen opened. The city has had much\ntrouble during the year in seeking to\nsecure better service from public utili\nty corporations but with the closing\nof the year it appears that most of\nthese problems have been satisfactorily\nmet. The new north side trunk sewer\nhas been started and is nearing comple\ntion, plans are under way to secure\nfiltration for the city water. The big\ngest problem that is being left over to\nthe new year is the problem of ar\nranging the tracks of the North-\nWestern Railway Company aud the\nproblem of securing the entrance of the\ninterurban cars to the heart of the\ncity. This problem was solved early\nin .1913, but the solution was found to\nbe an incomplete one.\nFinancially, the year has been a bet\nter one for the city than the preceding\none and, while taxes are higher than in\n1912, this was made necessary by the\ngreat increase in the state taxes.\nThe Industrial Year,\nAmong the industries of Kenosha\n1913 was a freak year. Up to the first\nof November it\' gave promise of prov\ning a record breaking year so the man\nufacturers, but the last two months of\nthe year have brought a slump. This\nis declared to be only temporary and\nmanufacturers agree that the opening\nof the new year will see nearly all the\nworkmen of Kenosha back in their old\npositions. No new industries of any\ngreat size have been established in the\ncity but a number of small plants have\nbeen opened and these promise to grow\ninto much greater industries before the\nend of another year. Many of the lo\ncal plants have made large additions\nduring the year and the number of em\nployed men and women in the city lias\nbeen increased.\nSchools Broaden Out.\nOne of the notable developments of\nthe year just closing was the broaden\ning out of the w\'ork of the publie\nschool system. Kenosha has done much\ntoward extending practical education\nfor its working classes and the city is\ndeclared to be a model for other cities\nin the state. Coupled with these move\nments have been movements for larger\nand better schools and for the build\ning of the new high school. The play\nground movement has been one of the\nreal live questions in Kenosha during\nthe year and plans which have matured\npromise to offer an early solution for\nthis problem in Kenosha.\nActive work has been done during\nthe year toward the extension of the\npark system of the city. This is cer\ntain to bear fruit within another year.\nNotable among the year’s accomplish\nments in the city was the completion\nof the wall about the Kenosha ceme\ntery. This is regarded as one of the\nOldest Paper\nIn\nThe Northwest\nNUMBER 36\nmost beautiful and substantial pieces\nof work ever done in Wisconsin.\nKenosha has added quo new church\nduring the year, the St. Anthony\'s\nchurch having been opened only a few\nmonths ago.\nThe most notable events of the year,\narranged in chronological order, fol\nlow:\nJanuary.\n3.

Towers, A. 8., J. of the\nMichigan Bar.\nWho Owns the Air?\n“Free as air” is ard\nso long as man had not succeeded in\nmastering the air this was true\nenough. There was air sufficient\nfor f I of us and as none could nay\nigate it with any success, questions\nof the control of the air did not\narise.\nBut now we the aeroplane\nand the airship and we are ; n what\npromises to be the beginning of an\nage of aviation. So it is that the\nlaw is beginning to develop: to keep\npace with the development of aero\nnautics. As yet flying machines are\nfew in number, but it seems that\nwe may well look forward to a time\nin the not far distant future when\nthe passage of aeroplanes and air\nships above us will be no uncom\nmon spectacle. What right has the\naeronaut to pass above our proper\nty? What are his liabilities in case\nhe causes injuries to those below\nhim? These and many similar\nquestions are arising, and the law\nis preparing to answer them as\nthey arise.\nIf one passes over your land, on\nthe surface, without your permis\nsion, be has committed a tresspass\nand though he may have caused no\nappreciable damage to your prem\nises, you may recover small dama\nges in a court of law by way of vin\ndication of your rights. What are\nyour rights against the aeronaut\nwho passes through the air above\nyour property? It is a fundamental\nrule of English law that a person’s\nproperty extends indefinitely down\nward and indefinitely upward. This\nrule has existed since the beginn\nings of law, and qnder it one has\ncontrol of the area above his land.\nA strict observance of this rule\nwould lead to this result: An aero\nnaut who passes above your land is\na technical trespasser, and though\nhe drops nothing upon you or yours,\nthough he cause you no real injury,\nhe has violated your rights —he has\ntrespassed—and you may sue him\nand recover damages. Such would\nbe the logical result of the applica\ntion of the law as it has long exist\ned in English-speaking countries.\nBut it seems highly improbable\nthat the law will be allowed to re\nmain in this condition. Aviation\nhas come to stay and it would seem\nto be a necessity that aeronauts be\nallowed to pass freely over the\nproperty beneath, whether it be pri\nvately owned or a public highway.\nThis necessity seems certain to\ncause a change in the law, which is\nlikely to come in the form of legis\nlative enactments concerning flying\nmachines. The French have already\ntaken action, a law having been re\ncently enacted which extends to\naeronauts free right to navigate the\nair, passing where they will. The\nnation retains the general control\nof the air, however, so that it may\nprevent any but French airships\nfrom flying over French territory,\nand make such regulations as may\nbe necessary.\nAmong the American states Con\nnecticut has taken the lead in pas\nsing legislation of this character.\nA law entitled “An Act Concerning\nthe Registration, Numbering, and\nUse of Air Ships, and the Licensing\nof Operators Thereof” was passed\nby that state in 1911. Under this\nlaw airships are subject to rules\nsimilar to those generally applied\nto automobiles. The owner must\nfile certain information with the\nSec. of State, pay a fee, receive a\ncertificate entitling him to fly, and\na number. This number must be\ndisplayed on the airship in letters\nnot less than three feet in height.\nAirships may be operated only by\nlicensed aeronauts.\nThis law fixes the responsibility\nfor all resulting damages in the fol-\nWE WISH YOU ALL A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR.\nThe River Falls Journal\nlowing section:\n“Every aeronaut shall be respon\nsible f>r all damages suffered in\nthis state by any >- son from injuries\ncaused by any voyage in an airship\ndirected by such aeronaut; aud if\nhe be the agent or employee of an\nother in making such voyage his\nprincipal or employer shall be re\nsponsible for such damage.”\nThe states of Massachusetts and\nNew York are considering similar\nlegislation and before many years\nit seems probable that every state\nwill have acted on this subject.\nThe question of fixing the respon\nsibility for damages, which b«s\nb ;en cared for in the Connecticut\nact, is one that is likely to be of\nimmediate importance. The dan\ngers of airships passing over prop\nerty are considerable. Parts, bag\ngage, or ballast might be dropped,\ncausing injury to persons or pro\nperty beneath. The fall of an aero\nplane upon a city might occasion\nsevere damage to those on land, as\nwell as to the unfortunate aeronaut\nBut fancy the damage resulting\nfrom the collision between two\ngiant airships of the Zepplin type\nWith the present interest in avia\ntion and the popular encourage\nment which it is receiving, the atti\ntude of the lawmakers is likely to\nbe favorable to them as far as\ngranting to them the right to freely\nuse the air is concerned Landown\ners are not likely to endeavor to de\nmand a fee from aeronauts passing\nover their property. The legisla\ntors are likely to grant great free\ndom of passage and the courts are\nlikely to sustain the legislation. Of\ncourse, a property owner might ob\nject that when the legislature grants\nthe right to navigate the air freely\nit gives a right to pass over his\nland and thus takes away from him\na portion of his property. Such a\ncontention, if made, will raise some\ninteresting cases, the result of\nwhich no one can foresee.\nBut as to fixing the responsibility\nfor injury resulting from the opera\ntion of airships, the law seems in\ndined to hold the aeronaut to strict\naccount. If the aeronaut wishes to\ntake the risk of riding in the air, he\nmust further take all the risk of\ncausing injury to persons or prop\nerty over which he passes. As mat\nters stand now, even in the absence\nof a statute fixing the responsibili\nties, as in Connecticut, a person in\njured by an airship may almost cer\ntainly recover damages from the\naeronaut. If a passing airship lets\ntall any object which injures your\nproperty you may sue the person\nwho is responsible for the operation\nof the airship.\nA few cases have already arisen\nin England. A British aeronaut\nwas driving his aeroplane and at\ntempted to descend into a field. The\nfield was occupied by a cow and the\ncow apparently resented the appear\nance of this strange object from\nabove. As the aeroplane descended\nthe cow rushed toward it, making\nhostile demonstrations. The aero\nnaut endeavored to avoid the infur\niated bovine, but was unsuccessfull\nand her cowship succeeded in plung\ning beneath the machine just as it\nreached the earth. The resu.ts\nwere disasterous to the cow, and\nthe sequel came when the farmer\nwho owned the cow sued the aero\nnaut and recovered damages for\nthe loss of the cow.\nThe aeroplane has found its way\ninto the classified ad columns as\nwell as into the courts, as witness\nhe following interesting ad which\nappeared in a German newspaper:\n“Lost from an aeroplane, a gold\nwatch and chain.

FREAR, MEMBER OF\nCONGRESS, 10th DISTRICT\nTwenty thousand people gathered\nChristmas Eve in front of the Capi\ntol to celebrate a community Christ\nmas tree. The President’s band\nwas stationed near the main steps.\nOn the lower steps were a thousand\nsingers who contributed their ser\nvices, while above and in front nl\nstatuary on either side of the en\ntrance were the wise men from the\nEast, angels with outstretched\nwings, Babe in the Manger and oth\ner figures in a series of tableaux.\nOut on the p.aza a few yards dis\ntant stood a huge Norway pine,\ncovered with thousands of incan\ndescent lights, with a brilliant elec\ntric star glistening from the top\nmost branch. Calcium lights thrown\nupon the figures added to the beau\nty of the occasion so that betw en\nmusic, lights and tableaux, it all\nemed a veritable faryland\nFrom where I was standing on\nthe steps, the spectacle was inspir\ning and it occurred to me that al\nthough every Preside t from Wash\nington and Lincoln down to Wilson\nhad looked cut from the same p irr\nand across the same plaza, none had\nwitnessed a more beautiful or im\npressive scene. No presents were\niven, no was slighted and do\nneart burnings followed Everybody\nwas welcome and the last remem\nbrance of the occasion was had\nfrom a mammoth electric sign\nreaching a hundred feet above and\nacross the main entrance of the\nCapitol, bearing the message to\n\'ens of thousuads, “Peace on Earth,\nGood Will to Men.”\nSenator LaFollette’s seaman’s\nnill has brought forth many protests\ntrom the shipping interests along\nlake Michigan.

One of th\nminagers of a line of lake vesse s\nwas heard to say he would not risk\nhis family on a nignt trip across\nthe lakes, because of the possibility\nof fire or other accident and con\nsequent loss of life. Under present\nconditions life boats are not pro\nvided for one-tenth of the passen\ngers on the average vessel, which\nillustrates the good judgment of\nthis manager in his desire to pro\ntect his own people from danger.\nLaFollette’s bill extends full pro\ntection to every passenger whether\nriding on the lake or ocean, or in a\nluxurious first cabin or down in the\nsteerage.\nCongressman Hayes of California\nis the senior member of the Re\npublican minority of the Banking\nCommittee that handled the cur\nrency bill.

WIS., JANUARY 2. 1914-\nMeal Inspection\nThe United Stales government pro\nvides for inspection of all meat picking\nplants which are engaged in interstate\nand foreign commerce. The, methods\nemployed in large plants are exceedingly\ninteresting. First, an inspection is made\nof all live animals and "suspects” arc\nculled for especially careful observation\nand regulated handling. After slaugh\nter, each nrocess in the further prepara\ntion of the carcass for the market, is\ncarefully watched The inspectors be\ncome highly skilled in the detection of\nevidences of diseased tissue which passes\nunder their eyes and hands.\nAs in the case of the first live Inspec\ntion upon the first suspicion of disease,\nan indelible brand sir-pends further prep\naration of the meat. The carcass is then\nshipped to a special examining room for\nfurther study and final disposition. By\nthis means, to reach the consumer the\nbody of a diseased animal would have to\npass the marvelously keen observation of\na number of highly skilled inspectors.\nThe diseases most often found are\ntuberculosis and actinomycosis in cattle;\ntuberculosis, hog cholera and various\nblood and organic diseases in swine.\nSome states have provided for inspec\ntion of abattoirs not under federal juris\ndiction. Wisconsin has made no such\nprovision. Dealers are sometimes sus\npected of offering for sale to inspected\npacking houses, only those animals which\nare presumably healthy. If this be so,\nmeat from uninspected slaughter houses\nis apt to be considerably below the nor\nmal average as concerns freedom from\ndisease.\nIn addition to the detection of diseased\nmeat, the inspectors maintain a close\nsnr yell lance over the general cleanliness\nof the plant. If the packers ever resent\ned the rigid demands of the government,\nno such resentment is now manifest.\nUndoubtedly, they recognize the govern\nment stamp of approval to he of distinct\ncommercial value.\nWonderful Cough Remedy\nDr. King’s New Discovery is known\neverywhere as the remedy which will\nsuwily stop a cough or*culd.

NUMBER 21\nPREVENTION FOR\nWHITE PLAGUE\nMedical Authority Tolls How To\nPrevent and Advises Patients\nShowing Symptoms\n“Tuberculosis has many characteristics\niji common with those of noxious weeds."\nI pon this theory the Wisconsin Anti-\nTuberculosis association has formulated\nits programme, according to Dr. 11. K.\nDoarholt of Milwaukee, director of the\nhealth bureau of the University of Wis\nconsin Extension division, and secretary\nof the organization.\n‘‘The must certain means of prevent\ning the spread of a weed pest is to gather\ncarefully and burn the seed," continued\nDoctor Dowrholt. Likewise, the most\ncertain way of preventing the spread of\nconsumption is to burn the seed.\n“Germs of consuption are contained in\nthe expectorations of patients suffering\nfrom the disease. Therefore if all ex\npectorations were carefully gathered\nin special cups, napkins and papers\nand burned before any of the seed\nwore scattered, tuberculosis would\nbecome historical. Karly knowledge at\nthe stage when the disease is most easily\ncured requires skillful diagnosis and\npatients should consult a skillful physi\ncian on first suspicion of infection, in\ndividuals who have been subjected to\nprolonged contact should have periodic\nexaminations extending over a number\nof years.\n“Providing sanitarium cure for ad\nvanced consumptives in a great measure\ncuts off the sources of infection. But a\nsufllcient number of sanatorium beds\nCan not be secured In a month or a year.\nAnd some patients may never consent to\ngo to a sanatorium. lienee we must pro\nvide as good protection as is possible\nfrom consumptives in the home. We can\naccomplish this by the visiting nurse\nand a wider knowledge of the funda\nmental facts in connection with the\nnature, cure, and prevention of the\ndisease."\nHog Cholera Don’ts\nThe following precautions are recom\nmended for keeping hog cholera from\nan uninfected drove by H T. Galloway,\nAsst. Sec. of Agriculture.\n1. Do not locate hog lots near a pul lie\nhighway, a railroad or n stream. The\ngerm of hog cholera may bo carried along\nany one of these avenues.\n2. Do not allow strangers or neighbors\nto enter your hog lots, and do not go in\nto your neighbors’ lots. If Is is absolute\nly necessary to pass from one hog lot in\nto another, lirst clean your shoes care\nfully and then wash them with a 21 per\ncent solution of the compound solution\nof crosol (U. S. P.)\n3. Do not put now slock, either hogs\nor cuttle, in lots with a herd already on\nthe farm. Newly purchased hogs should\nbe put in separate enclosures well sepa\nrated from the herd on the farm and\nkept under observation for three weeks,\nbecause practically all stock cars, un\nloading chutes, and pens are infected\nwith hog cholera, and hogs shipped by\nrail are therefore apt to contract hog\ncholera.\n4. Hogs sent to fairs should be quar\nantined for at least three weeks after\nthey return to the farm.\n5. If hog cholera breaks out on a\nfarm, separate the sick from the appar\nently healthy animals, and burn all car\ncasses of death. Do not leave* them mi\nburned, or this will endanger all other\nfarmers in the neighborhood.\n<5. If after the observance of all possi\nble precautions hog cholera appears on\nyour farm, notify the State veterinarian,\nor State Agricultural college, and secure\nserum for the treatment of those not\naffected. The early application of tills\nserum Is essential.\nSome of these precautions may seem\nunnecessary and troublesome, but they\ndo not cost much, and they are very\nvaluable preventive measures.\nThe Tax Kate\nThe tax rate in this city for the cur\nrent year is $16,00 per $1,0)0 in the Jef\nferson county wards and $18.13 in the\nDodge county wards* If the assesnirnt\nIs 90 per cent of the actual value, the\nrate is excessive: if the asnessed valua\ntion is moderate then the rate Is reason\nable —on the whole however Watertown\nhas no cause for complaint, below we\ngive the tax rate per 11,000 in some of\nthe other cities of the state:\nAn tigo $29.00, Bar a boo $23, 01, Beaver\nDarn s23.2o, Hoscobel S2B 00, Beloit $17.4b,\nBurlington $24,07, Edgerton 118.94, Kan\nClaire $23.50, Jefferson SIB.BO, Madison\n$16.50, Monroe $17.00, Oshkosh sl7 50,\nPltttteville 117.23, Portage $20.00, Janes\nville $15.00, Milwaukee 118.00, La Crosse\n$25,00, Richland Center $29.40, Toinah\n$20.12, Btonghton $18.70, Whitewater\n$25.90, W aterloo $17.94, Waukesha $19.50,\nLake Geneva $23.81,\nAn Ideal Woman’s Laxative\nWho wants to take salts, or castor oil,\nwhen there is nothing better than Dr.\nKing’s New Life Pills for all bowel\ntroubles.

Hayn\nhat so-eben eine umfangreiche Arbei:\nzum Abschluß gebracht, und deren\nErgebnis soll demnächst in Gestalt\neiner Mondtarte veröffentlicht wer\nden. Es handelt sich hierbei um eine\nmöglichst g-nmue Karte der Randge\nbirge des Mondes, die zur genauen\nBahnbestimmung des Mondes von\neinschneidender Bedeutung ist und\nneues Marerial zur Theorie der\nMondbewcaung beibringt. Sonne\nund Planeten erscheinen nämlich, we\ngen ihrer größeren Entfernung, als\nKreise oder Ellipsen, und so ist ihre\ngenaue Ortsbestimmung nicht beson\nders schwierig; der Mond dagegen\nerscheint nicht kreis- oder ellipsen\nförmig begrenzt, und daher ließ sich\nbisher sein Mittelpunkt oder Schwer\nPunkt nickt genau genug bestimmen.\nMan sucht: bisher diesem Uebelstande\ndurch E\'i\'füvrung eines „Fixpunttes"\nabzuhelfen, dessen selenographEche\nKoordinaten bestimmt wurden. Hayn\nbat nun den aussichtsreicheren Weg\neingeschlagen, den Mondmittelvunft\nbesser zu definieren und dazu eine\nmöglichst genaue Karte des Mond\nrandes anzustellen und alle Beobach\ntungen aus möglichst viele Punkte des\nUmfanges -u bestehen.\nEs stur cm Ganzen 200 Mond\nbitder hnaestellt und 10,000 Punkte\nmit ihren\' skleno-graphischen Koordi\nnaten festgelegt.

Und so ist es denn\nauch wohl als ein Akt ausgleichen\nder Gerechtigkeit aufzufassen, daß die\nLebewesen, die, statt sich wie die an\ndern auf ehrliche Weise durchs Le\nben zu schlagen, die bequemeren Da\nseinsbedingungen des Schmarotzer\ntums auszunutzen gelernt haben und\nvon den mühsam erworbenen Körper\nsästen anderer Wesen sich mäste,\nauch ihrerseits wieder, wenn auch\nwiderwillig, als Wirte aufzutreten\ngezwungen werden.\nDie Naturgeschichte kennt eine\nganze Reihe solcher Schmarotzer in\nSchmarotzern: zu ihnen gehört nach\nden Forschungen des Franzosen rw\nweran auch der Floh, der lustige\nSpringer, dem bekanntlich die größ\nte Kälte nichts anhaben kann. Der\nFamilie der Flöhe ist überhaupt in\nden letzten Jahren von der Forschung\nein außerordentliches Interesse ent\ngegengebracht worden, da man ver\nschiedene ihrer Angelürigen in dem\nbegründeten Verdacht hatte, daß sie\nbei der Uelertragung vcn allerlei an\nsteckenden Krankheiten ein? nicht ein\nwandfreie Nolle spielten. Auch der\nParasit, den Laweran im Hundefloh\nauffand, kann auf andere Tiere über\ntragen werden. Er stellt ein mi\nkroskopisch kleines Schräubchen vor,\ndas sich vom Darminhalt nährt, sich\nin ihni bewegt und entwickelt. Bringt\nman mit Hilfe einer Manipulation,\nzu der allerdings e\'was geschickte\nFinger gehören, den Darminhatt de-\nFlohs in eine schwache Kochsalzlö\nsung und spritzt diese weißen Mäu\nsen ein. so findet man die Spirillen\nbald in den Blutkörperchen der\nMäuse, wo sie wahrscheinlich ihre\nweitere Entwicklung durchmachen.\nDie Erscheinung, daß Schmarotzer\nwieder vcn anderen Schmarotzern\nheimgesucht werden, findet sich auch\nsonst. So werden gewisse Schlupf\nwespenlarven, die in Schmclterlings\nraupen leben, wieder von kleineren\nSchlupfwespen angestochen, obgleich\nsie dort allem Anschein nach vor\ntrefflich geschützt sind. Ja. es komm!\nder besondere Fall vor, daß das\nMännchen einer parasitisch lebenden\nTierart als Schmarotzer seines eben\nfalls an die parasitische Lebensweise\nangepaßten Weibchens auftritt. Die\nser immerhin seltene Fall von T-p\n-pelparasitismus findet sich bei ge\nwissen Rankenfußk\'-etssen. zu denen\nauch die Entenmuscheln gehören: das\nMänncken sucht schon als vollstän\ndig ausgerüstete Larve das Weibchen\nauf, verliert hier seine Beweglichkeit\nund seine Gliedmaßen vollkommen\nund lebt als Zwergmännchen weich\neingebettet in der Schal? des Weib\nchens und nährt sich, indem es die\nSäfte des Weibchens einfach mit\nder Körperbau! aussäugt: denn ihm\nfehlt später auch der Mund und\nder Darm vollständig.\nEin noch krasserer Fall von Pa\nrasitismus. bei dem allerdings da?\nWeibchen frei lebt, findet sich bei den\nzu den Sternwürmcrn gehörigen Bo>\nnellia des Mitlelmeeres; hier leben\ndie Männcken sogar im Fruchthalter\ndes Weibchens, zwischen den von\ndiesen beroorgebrachtrn Eiern, die\nvon ibnen befruchtet werden.

So gaben zu\nAnfang des Krieges verschiedene der\nägäischen Inseln besondere Briefmar\nker, heraus, z. B. Jkanen, Mytilenr,\nSamos und Lemnos. Griechenland\nversah die in den eroberten Gebieten\nverwendeten Marken mit einem be\nsonderen Ueberdruck, und neuerdings\nhat auch der werdende Staat Alba\nnien sich schon mit der Herausgabe\nvon eigenen Briefmarken befaßt. Zu\nerst verwendete man dort türkisch\nMarken, die mit einem höchst primi\ntiven albanischen Adler überdruckt\n\'Wurden. In der letzten Zeit aber hat\nman\'einen regelw-chten Stempel ange\nfertigt, welcher die Inschrift trägt\n„Postat c Qeverrics se Perlohefhme":\ndiese Marke wurde in den Werten zu\n2E Para und l Piaster herausgege\nben, d. h. die Postbeamten stellen sie\nselbst her. indem sie diesen Stempel\nauf ein Stück Papier drucken und auf\nden ihnen übergebenen Brief Neben.\nGriechenland hat den Briefmarken\nsammlern im legten Stadium noch\neine ganze Reihe bon provisorischen\nMarken beschert, die zu den seltensten\ngehören, welche seit Ansang dieses\nJahrhundcris überhaupt ausgegeben\nwurden. So hatten die Bulgaren in\nder für einige Zeit besetzten Hafen\nstadt Kawalla iyr eigenen Marlen\neingeführt. AIS die Griechen diesen\nOrt einnahmen, fanden sie einen klei\nne Nest dieser Marken vor und ver\nsahen sie schnell mit einem griechischen\nAusdruck. Von einzelnen dieser Pi"\nvisoricn sind nur 10 Stück hergestellt,\nwodurch sich ihre Seltenheit erklärt.\nAls die griechische Floite vor Dedca\ngatsch lag, wurden auf ihren Schiffen\nBriefe zur Weiterbeförderung ange\nnommen. In Ermangelung von\nMarken fertigte man amtlich recht\neckige Papierstücke an, die mit einer\ngriechischen Inschrift und der Wert\nangabe bedruckt wurden. Als diese\nVorräte zu Ende gingen, nahm man,\nwie in Kawalla. bulgarische Marken\nund bedruckte sie ähnlich wie dort.\nSehr selten sind auch die in G\nmüldschina ausgegebenen Provisorien\nzu 10 und 25 Lepta. Diese Stadt\nwar ursprünglich von den Bulgaren\nerobert, wurde aber dann von den\nGriechen besetzt.

Während\ndieser Zeit hat man nun türiische\nBricsmar\'en, die inan vorfand, mit\neinem mehrzelligen Ueberdruck in\ngriechischer Sprache versehen und\nauch noch das griechische Wappen hin\nzugefügt.

John B. Densmore\nof the department of labor so an\nnounced after a final effort to bring\nthe warring interests together.\nHe did not hesitate to Marne his\nfailure upon the uncompromising at\ntitude of the mine owners, who re\nfused to recognize the Western Fed\neration of Miners as a party to arbi\ntration proceedings or other peace\nprojects.\nDensmore Tells Story.\n“In a nutshell, the question was\nwhether the union men should go back\nto work with or without discrimina\ntion. The companies refused to do\nanything but discriminate against\nmembers of the union,” said Mr. Dens\nmore.\n“It means a struggle to the bitter\nend,” said O. N. Hilton, chief of coun\nsel of the Western Federation of\nMiners, who has represented Presi\ndent C. H. Moyer here since the lat\nter’s deportation. “The outcome is\ndue entirely to the attitude of the\ncompanies. They wanted everything\nand would concede nothing.”\nCompromise Is Rejected.\nThe union’s last word was an offer\nto withdraw the Western federation\nTom the field, its place to be taken by\n. union affiliated with the Michigan\nFederation of Labor, the United Mine\nWorkeis, with which the Western Fed\neration of Miners is affiliated, or some\nsimilar body. This was rejected ab\nsolutely by the companies.\nThe employing interest suggested to\nMr. Densmore that a secret vote of the\nmen on strike, if properly safeguard\ned, would show a majority of them in\nfavor of returning to work outside the\nunion fold. When this was broached\nto the federation men there was an\nimmediate declination to submit the\ncase to any such test. Word of the\nnegotiations was telegraphed to the\nsecretary of labor by Mr. Densmore.\nHe said that a full report of the ef\nforts made would be made by him aft\ner his return to Washington.\nThe strike has been in progress\nsince July 23. Now that Mr. Dens\nmore has given up and is going back\nto Washington, there are prophecies\nthat it will last much longer. J. E.\nRoach, a representative of Samuel\nGompers, president of the American\nFederation of Labor, said:\n“This strike will not be settled for\neight months. It will run longer than\nthat. It will go a year. The American\nfederation will aid the strikers, and\nother organizatinos will help.”\nAttack on Moyer Up to Grand Jury.\nThe Houghton county grand jury\nwas specifically charged by Judge H.\nH. O’Brien of the circuit court to in\nvestigate the kidnaping of Moyer.\nMoyer was forcibly deported, beaten\nand shot.\n“If the jury believes there is reason\nable amount of evidence pointing to\nward persons connected with the kid\nnaping, they are* to be investigated\nand indicted,” Judge O’Brien charged.\nThe grand jury is made up of James\nMacNaughton’s chauffeur, Edgar Bye,\nseveral mine superintendents and two\nSocialists. The evidence is being\nplaced before the grand jury by\nGeorge Nichols, a special prosecutor\nappointed by Governor Ferris to con\nduct the investigation.\nJudge O ltrien has been condemned\nby the mine mauagers and the mem\nbers of the Citizens’ alliance without\nmercy. Placards charging that he\ntried to mediate the strike in the\ncause of the Western Federation of\nMiners have been posted on the bill\nboards in Calumet township, and in\nthe Calumet & Hecla stamp mills one\nof the largest posters is displayed.\nFerris on Way to Calumet.\nCalumet, Mich., Jan. s.—Governor\nFeriis, Labor Commissioner Cunning\nham and Secretary Nesbit will arrive\nin the copper country tonight. The\ngovernor will prosecute a vigorous in\nvestigation of the strike in the hopes\nof bringing about a settlement. He\nis accompanied by several lower\nMichigan labor leaders.\nSilver Wedding.\nMr. and Mrs. Joe Biicb, of Bee\ntown celebrated the twenty-fifth an\nniversary of their wedding Friday\nevening, Dec. 19.

Very much of this criticism\nis bad because it is unsound, untrue,\nand while objecting to tbe existing,\nhas nothing better to substitute. All\nof it is uDfortudate because it lowers\nthe value of a school education in the\nminds of unthinking people who need\nthe school the most. It is not at all\nunusual to find articles in any paper\nor magazine today bearing the title cf\nthis paragraph. Tbe following dis\ncussion which answers tbe question\nnegatively, written hy ,T. W.

So\nfar as tbe parents are concerned the\nproblem is simple. They will live a\nwhile, herded as sheep are herded,\nthen they die, But their children\nare the greatest problem on earth\ntoday. Let us see the work of the\nNew Y 7 ork schools un them, by a\nstudy of the past.\nFifty years ago the Irish formed\nthe chief factor in the unskilled\nlabor population. Walk along any\nbusiness street and one might be sure\nof seeing signs reading— ‘Man wanted ;\nno Irish need apply. ’ Well, the\nadult generation lived and died; that\nwas all. Their children went to the\npublic scbcol. but they were never\nin any great proportion unskilled\nlaborers. The third generation of\nthese Irish immigrants is still living\nin New York City. Who are they,\nand what are they ’ The answer is\neasy : they are the greatest factor in\nthe political and industrial energy of\nthe state—senators, congressman,\nengineers, contracture, clergymen,\neducators and railroad builders. And\nthe Jews of three generations ago?\nbankers, merchants, and capitalists.\nBoth nationalities are furnishmg tbe\nred blood of tbe country today.\nPardon another heresy ; the red blood\nis worth a lot more to the country\nthan the blue blood.\nNow it has been shown that if the\nhuman mind goes without training\nbetween the ages of six and twenty it\nceases to grow. Suppose that all these\nyouugsters of foreigD born parentage\nbad grown up without school train\ning. The answer to this is also easy ;\nthey would have been just what\ntheir grand parents were—the flotsam\nand jetsam of civilization.\nIn the city of Mount Vernon. New\nYork, it costs about six hundred dol\nlars to steer a youngster through the\nelementary aud high schools The\naverage income of one hundred men\ngraduates of the high schol is not far\nfrom fifteen hundred dollars a year.\nAt five percent this is the income on\nthirty thousand dollars. Ia other\nwords, we invest six hundred dollars\nand tbe product commands just fifty\ntimes that sum What a failure!”\nTHE WINTER SHORT COURSE\nMention was made in this column a\nshort time ago of the winter short\ncourses which were being introduced\nin a number of Wisconsin high\nschools this year. From the reports\nia the educational papers, the idea is\nnot wholly confined to this state.\nThe Geneseo, Illinois, Township High\nSchool has begun such a course for\ncountry boys. The course started\nDecember first with an enrollment of\ntwenty-four boys, ranging in age\nfrom fifteen to twenty years, and in\nadvancement, from the eighth grade\nto the third year of the high school.\nThe establishment of the course\nthere is the result of a definite de\nmand on the part of the farmer tax\npayers who have not been receiving\nthe benefits they tbiuk tbey ought to\nhave from the money they are pay\ning, because they need their boys for\nfall and spriug work on the farms.\nInquiries made by Principal Beatty\ndeveloped the fact that there were\nenough of the country boys interest\ned in the proposed coarse to warrant\nthe undertaking, hut it was not ex\npected that the enrollment for the\nfirst year would be more than twelve\nor fifteen.\nFive classes have been organized\nand each student is enrolled for four\nof the five; all but one are in the\nagriculture class.

Bennett.\nJohn H. Bennett was born in Corn\nwall, England, December 24, 1846.\nHe was brought to America with his\npaients when but six months old and\nlived with them in New York two\nyears. He had been a resident of\nSouthwestern Wisconsin forty years—\ntwenty-seven of which he resided in\ntownship of Lancaster. At tbe\nMethodist parsonage in this city he\nwas married on January 1, 1873, to\nMiss Eliza C. Keretzer. Fonr chil\ndren came to bless their home, tbe\neldest, a sweet little girl of two and\none-half years, guing at that early\nage into the heavenly home. The\nonly other daughter, Mamie, in tbe\nbeauty of early womanhood died after\na lingering illness and mourned cf\nmany, April 7, 1908. Suddenly May\n26, 1913 while on a visit to tbe son\nPhil, wbb lived at Mather, this state,\ntbe beloved wife and mother took her\ndeparture for that land from whence\nnone return. Tbe dear body was\nbrought to Lancaster that it might\nrepose beside ber children. The bus\nband was broken hearted and would\nnot be comforted. He had been\ncrippled by disease and for many of\ntbe daily comforts of life was de\npendent upon the loving, faithful\nministries of his wife. None could\ntake her place. For some months be\nremained with his brother aDd sister,\nMr. and Mrs. Philip Beunett where\nhe received all the kindly attention\nthey could bestow. Then the son\nPhil came back to the tld borne in\nthis city where he and his wife tried\nto make tbe father comfortable aud\nhappy But he mourned incessantly,\nand prayed to be delivered of this life\nthat be might be reunited with his\nloved ‘‘Eliza ” Existence tc bim\nwas only a burden without her com\npanionship Had he been strong and\nable bodied, he probably would have\ntaken up bis cross and borne it brave\nly as others do under irreparable\nlosses. In his decrepit state is it any\nwonder be so mourned so loyal a help\nmeet as Bennett was. The lov\ning Father noted his sorrow, and\nheeded tbe cry of bis heart. On the\nmorning of December 19, 1913, while\nsitting in bis chair with not a long\nwarning of his near approach, tbe\ndeath angel touched bim gently and\nhe passed peacefully away.

These coats are made in\nthe regulation slip on style, from an\nintegral part of waterproof paper.\nTheir production cost will be no\nhigbtr than 5 cents each, and even\nthat figure can be lessened. The coat\ncan be folded np to fit in any ordinary\neuvelope and is particulary adapted\nto bring carried in bandoags\nThe coats can be made of oiled\npaper or paraffin, vellum parchment\npaper, which gives the appearance of\nsilkiness at a short distance. Tbe\noriginal idea was for the coats to be\nworn only once, but after a trial, it\nwas demonstrated tbat they could be\nutilized successfully two or three\ntimes. The coats are re-inforced\nwhere the buttons are sewed on and\nalso where the button holes are cut.\nThere are only two seams, both\nrunning underneath tbe arms and\ndown the sides.

A mystery\nsurrounds the affair as it is not\nknown who did the shooting. It is\nthought that whoever fired the\nshot, was either trying to kill Mr.\nLoock’s dog or mistook it for a\nTa\'bbit. The dog was close to Mr.\nLoock\'s right leg when the shot was\nfired. The dog was killed and part\nof the charge entered the right leg,\nankle and foot of Loock. He was\nbrought to this city and received\nmedical attention. The wounds while\nnot serious are painful and will prob\nably keep Mr. Loock confined to the\nhouse a week.\nFaxes of Town of Grand Rapids\nare new payable at my office, room\nNo. 5, old Wood County National\nBank block, opposite post office up\nstairs.

Found In Home of\nFriend by Officers.\nThe attempt of Elizabeth Hensehel,\nfifteen years old, to commit suicide,\ncaused a great deal of excitement in\nthe fourth ward Saturday evening.\nMiss Hensehel left home about six\no’clock Saturday evening, because\nshe fea-ed her father. She had stated\nfollowing a beating he had given her\non a previous occasion, that if he\never beat her again she would kill\nherself. She went to the river and\nattempted to get into deep water,\nbut was unsuccessful and finally gave\nit up and wandered to the house of\na friend where she was taken care\nof and afterward found by the offi\ncers.\nAccording to the story told by the\ngirl and the officers, she intended\nto drown herself, hut because of the\nshallow water and ice she did not\nsucceed. It is said that several\nweeks ago her father gave her a\nsevere beating and she made the\nstatement that she would kill her\nself if he ever beat her again. Sat\nurday evening Hensehel learned that\nshe had been to a moving picture\nshow and began to raise a row. The\ngirl fled from the house. Officer\nBanter and Undersheriff Bluett were\nsent for and took up the hunt for the\nmissing girl. She was traced to the\nriver and the place where she| start\ned out on the ice was discovered\nSearch along the hank showed where\nshe had come back to shore. The of\nficers agreed that she had probably\nbeen unable to get to deep water\nand had returned to shore and was\nin the home of some friend. A sys\ntematic search of all the houses in\nthe neighborhood was commenced.\nThe officers were not saitsfied with\nthe verbal denial of the people but\ninsisted upon searching the houses.\nThe girl was finally found at the\nhome of Emil Toeple on Burt street.\nMr. and Mrs. Toeple took the girl\nin and had put her to bed under\nwarm blankets. It was after eleven\no’clock before the sdhrch was over.\nThe father finally arrived and got\nclothing for the girl and took her\nback to her home.\nDISCUSS WORK\nOF CIRCUIT COURT\nSay Double Trial System Should\nBe Abolished.\nThe circuit judges of the state\nhave been in session at Madison,\nwith the committee of lawyers ap\npointed at the last session of the\nlegislature to investigate court sys\ntems.\nThat the double trial system in\nprobate matter® is a drag on the\ncourts and should be abolished, was\none of the decisions reached. Judge\nA. H. Reid of Wausau and others\ndeclared there should be either an\nappeal from county court to .supreme\ncourt or else, when an issue is. join\ned in probate court, that the matter\nbe certified to circuit court for\ntrial.\nThere w r as considerable discussion\nover the proposed abolition of the\noffice of justice of the peace, but\nno decision was reached.\nThis was the first meeting of the\nlegislative committee since appoint\nment. It will report to the next leg\nislature the result of the investiga\ntion and submit a plan that appears\nto best suit the state needs and\nmeet with the approval of the state\njudiciary.\nMonday evening the circuit judges\nwere entertained at a banquet at\nwhich Judge W. J. Turner of Milwau\nkee, spoke of the divorce evil. He\nsaid that probably 5d per cent of the\ndivorces in Milwaukee county might\nhe avoided if anew system of grant\ning divorces was devised. Judge\nTurner believes that the legislature\nshould pass a law creating the posi\ntion of divorce lawyer to be appoint\ned by the circuit judge and no divorc\naction could be brought, except bj\nthis mam. “I think,’’ said Judge\nTurner, “that there are a large\nnumber of divorces brought b> law\nvers’ runners, who have brought out\nan evil as great as the ambulance\nchaser in personal injury cases. Then\ntoo. divorced women often urge wo\nmen who have had a quarrel to get\na lawyer and get a divorce. These\nremarks were made in refernece to\nMilwaukee county cases. Judge Turn\ner said he did not believe that the\nsame conditions prevailed in every\ncounty of the state.\nENDORSES SENATOR HATTON\nThe Eagle-Star is glad to note that\nWilliam H. Hatton of New London,\nis an announced candidate for the\nRepublican gubernatorial nomination.\nWe have contended for months that\nhe was the key to the situation for\nthe Republicans of Wisconsin. No\nother man, so far mentioned, com\nbines all the qualities necessary in\na candidate for the chief executive\nship, as he does. The Republicans of\nWisconsin have before them the big\ngest state fight of two decades. The\nstate situation, a Democratic presi\ndent in the chair, favor the opposi\ntion and it will need all the resources\nof a united Republican party to carry\nthe next state election. Mr. Hatton\nwill unite the parties as no other\nman can and is an ideal man for\nthe Then why not do\nthe logical thing. Republicans, and\nnominate him?—Marinette Eagle-Star\nMOTOR NUMBERS\nCO OUTOF STILE\nNew Number Plates of a Better\nDesign\nMOTORIST TO BE GIVEN TIME\nState is Unable to Provide Applicants\nWith License Numbers —Sorpe\nNew Numbers Here.\nRaus mat the 1913 automobile num\nbers. They went out of date at mid\nnight Wednesday, That was the last\nsecond that the 1913 licenses were\ngood. A few Grand Rapids automo\nbile owners already have their new\nnumbers. Those who have declare\nthat they are an improvement over\nthe 1913 numbers, because they are\nof better make-up and are more dis\ntinguishable.\nThe 1914 number plates are made\nfrom one piece of sheet steel, the\nnumber being pressed into relief in\nstead of tacked on as they wqre\nin 1913. The background of the num\nber plate is ena.maled white and the\nnumbers are enameled black, conse\nquently the Wisconsin number plate\nhave about all the contrast colors\nwill permit.\nThe new numbers are slightly\nwider than the §ld onesi, and the fact\nthat they are pressed from the steel\nplate instead of tacked on to it will\nmake it easier for motorists to keep\nt v -cl 0 ? -\'V fl .ip e&jbi q s-ha l^ ■\nNo one will be arrested: if he de\nports himself on country roads or\ncity streets with the 1913 number\nplate attached. The state department\nis so swamped with applications for\nnew numbers that it is impossible to\nissue new numbers fast enough. The\nfact that there are more automobiles\nin service this winter than ever be\nfore has only served to increase the\nrush of applicants.\nThe law, leisurely interpreted, give\nmotorists time enough to get their\nnumbers and run with the old ones\non until they do, because the state\nknows that before very much time\nelapses new numbers will be procur\ned. So apply for new numbers and\ndrive with the old ones until the\nstate sends you the new black and\nwhit© figures.\nTWO APPOINTED\nOK COUNTY JUDGE\nSoldier.s Relief Committee Now\nComplete Again.\nThe vacancies on the Soldiers’\nRelief Committee have been filled\nby County Judge - W.

By the time the offi\ncer got through he had a collection\nof three of the most interesting\n“gats” that have come to light in\nthis community in years. One gun\nwas a short regular British Bull Dog\nrevolver, another was a double bar\nreled derringer of about 44 caliber\nand the last was a four barreled\nbrass muzzle loading outfit that must\nhave been handed down from the\nearly German wars.

All members were\npresent.\nThe bridge committee recommended\nthat all bids for lengthening the spans\nof Bth street bridge be rejected and\nthat at the\' April election the following\nthree questions be submitted to the\npeople; new bridge, rebuilding present\nbridge and no change.

The electric\nplant is now a municipal utility owned\nand operated by the city, and tempor\narily managed by the electric commit\ntee of the city council, composed of\nRalph Plumb, Charles Frazier and\nMartin Georgenson, who with the at\ntorney conducted all the negotiations\nwith Mr. John Schuette for closing\nthe transfer. They report that all\ndealing with Mr. Schuette was pleas\nant, he meeting them more than half\nway on all open points. The total cost\nwas $146,000. Bonds to cover this,\nwhich the company will take, are be\ning printed.\nAn ordinance was introduced prohi\nbiting, except in certain specified cas\nes, the blowing of boiler Hues of steam\nships in the harbor. Jt was referred\nto the judiciary committee.\nThe sexton, street commissioner,\nhealth officer, visiting nurse and police\nchief all had annual or quarterly re\nports on file. The chief’s report of\narrests was classified every way possi\nble and showed that in 1913 about 630\nCaucasians lone nigger were\narrested in this city. The chief wants\na motorcycle to make more certain the\nhaling to justice of the motor speed\nfiends. The police committee will re\nport on this. He also expressed his\nthanks to everyone except the Daily\nNews.\nThe mayor has an idea that it would\nbe a good plan to buy the lot aAolnirg\nthe Franklin street fire station, evi\ndently having a future city hail in\nview. It excited some debate. Thori\nson is against the hall idea, / Plumb\nagainst the site. The finance commit\ntee will get a price on tho lot.\nThe Judicairy committee will get a\nprice, if possible, on the Vilas lot, be\ntween the stand pipe and the Schuette\nresidence. This caused more airing of\nideas. Tho mayor thinks the railroad\nbridges will some day be ordered re\nmoved.\nThe fire committee recently put pav\ning brick floors in the horse stalls at\nthe north side station where 5 of the 7\nhorses are kept. Schroeder, Lippen\nand Scherer made a vigorous attack on\nthis scheme claiming it lames the\nhorses. Thorison and chief Kratz up\nheld the other side. It gotquite warm\nand the mayor had to spread the salve.\nThorison says it saves lumber and the\nchief’s big point was that it makes the\nsleeping quarters of his men more san\nitary.\nAbout once in two months some al\nderman questions the Jagodzinsky per\nsonal injury claim which is allowed at\nevery meeting.

Business was\nentirely suspended in this town during\nFriday, Saturday and Monday—no oue\nbeing able to be out doors any length\nof time. The material in our office\nwas frozen together so that the hands\ncould not touch the type or work the\npress, which will account for the ab\nsence of any paper last week. We\nwere without mail an entire week.\nThe cold weather extended through\nout the country and we hear of many\ncases of suffering on the railroads and\nother thoroughfares.\nEffects of The Cold—We notice\nby our exchanges that throughout the\nwhole State the severity of the weath\ner was extremely felt, and in many\nplaces we hear of persons being badly\nfrozen—in a few instances resulting in\nloss of life. In this section we have\nheard of but few sufferers. One un\nfortunate fellow, residing in Brown\ncounty, had both his feet frozen so\nbadly that it was at first supposed he\ncould not live, but through the skill\nful efforts of Dr. Balcom, ho is in k\nfair way to recover, though amputation\nof one of the limbs was found to be\nnecessary.\nA Large Establishment — Mr.\nWilliam liabr, the well known Brewer\nhas just completed a very large estab\nlishment for the manufacture of lager\nbeer, and at his invitation many of our\ncitizens visited his cellar on Saturday\nlast. The principal cellar is 75 by 54\nfeet, 16 feet deep, with stone walls\nthree feet thick. Within this is an ice\nhouse 20 by 40 feet, with stone walls\ntwo and a half feet thick. Adjoining\nthe main room is a yeasting cellar 56\nx 20 feet, covered with solid masonry.\nMr. Ruhr\'s establishment is one of\nthe largest and finest in the state, and\nwe hope large expense incur\nred by him will be returned four-fold.\nU is enterprise and public spirit should\nbe followed by others.\nLincoln wants more men —We\nthought the Emancipation Procla\nmation was to put an end to me wdr!\nHow is that?\nTWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO.\nHon.

Her funeral\nlook ])iace on Sunday and a large num\nber of friends testified their respect by\ntheir attendance. The stricken rela\ntives have the sympathy of the entire\ncommunity.\nUncle Wood and John Schuette have\nquit singing on Sylvester eve. The\npeople who assemble at Turner Hall\nfeel the deprivation much though the\ntuneful efforts of the men were far\nfrom pleasing. Sylvester Eve is not\nwhat it used to be.\nPeople who, as Tom Windiate would\nsay “were on earth in 1804” were busy\non Tuesday last contrasting it with\nthe first day of January 1804. Then a\nperson could hardly stir outside with\nout being frozen, while Tuesday last\nwas as balmy as a day in May.\nEd. Sams of Mishioott while walking\naround the barn of J. L.

A warm rain\nwould bring them out in full leaf.\nThis stale of things brought out some\nfurther facts of the unprecedented mild\nness of the winter.

This will prevent the early rob\nin item from making its appearance in\nlocal papers next April.\nNew Years day was a day fit to in\nspire a poet. The sleighing was ex\ncellent, the face of the sky was not\nmarred by a cloud sjieck and the sun\nshone bright. In the afternoon Eighth\nstreet was thronged with people urg\nging horses of all conditions to do their\nprettiest, while the river was crowded\nwith skaters.

Vet\nthese are the very places most in need\nof it. In the larger centers competent\ndoctors are available, and in the cities\nfree medical and dental clinics may al\nways be found, but in the country med\nical and dental attention is often diffi\ncult to obtain.\nAgain, people in the country are\nlittle inclined to seek aid from physic\nians or dentists, simply because they\nhave not yet been educaflAi to do so\nexcept in serious cases. It therefore\nhappens that children of the rural\nschools are in general (contrary to the\ngeneral impression) more in need of\nmedical and dental attention than the\nchildren of larger communities.\nThere is also a common impression\nthat country children are naturally\nmore vigorous than city children.\nr i his ought to bo true, but unfortun\nately it is not. In general food is not\nas well prepared in the country as it\nis in the city; the available variety is\nsmaller; the houses and schools are\nless well ventilated, overheating in\nwinter is common; tuberculosis is not\nso well understood and the chances for\n“house infection” are therefore great\ner; and general public sanitation is\nalmost without exception neglected in\nthe country.\nChildren in the country are more ex\nposed to unfavorable weather condi\ntions than are city children. They of\nten walk long distances in extreme\nheat, cold, or wet; and sit in school\nwith damp clothing or wet feet. They\nalmost invariably wear 100 much cloth\ning indoors in cold weather, and are\nconsequently overheated in the school\nroom and then are chilled on the way\nhome. Under such conditions it is no\nwonder that colds and other respira\ntory disorders are common, and that\nmany country children are out of\nschool on account of various kinds of\nsickness\nTin sanitation of a rural school is\nusually very bad. The common drink\ning cup hangs from a nail over the\nwater pail; floors and desks are often\nvery dirty; ventilation is a negligible\nquantity; outdoor toilets are in un\nspeakable condition; washing facilities\nare either not provided at all, or con\nsist of a pail of water, a dirty tin basin,\nand one common towel.- From U, S.\nliureau of Kducation Letter.\nThe above letter needs to be heeded\nat this time of the year. There is\nmuch sickness throughout the county\nand city. Several schools were closed\nbefore the holidays. School boards\ncannot give the matter of fumigation\ntoo much attention at this time. The\nschool house ought to disinfected fre\nquently now. Some children catch\ndiseases from each other very readily.\nTake alt necessary precaution, it is\ncheaper than paying doctor bills, and\nmay prevent an epidemic in the com\nmunity.\nBl) v LAND ON EASY TEHMS.\nCut over hard wood lands in Wiscon\nsin, from 915.00 per acre up. 91 00 per\nacre cash, balance in monthly install\nments of 9. r j.oo on each forty (.ought.\nNo better proiswltion known.

Ills being a\nmarried man adds to the gravity of the\noU\'ense, if it was committed. Yester\nday he waived examination and was\nbound over for trial at the April term\nof the Sheboygan circuit court.

Physicians are prohibited\nfrom charging more than $3.00 for the\nexamination. The law seems to re\nquire certain modern laboratory tests\nof the blood which doctors say will\nlake weeks of time and alxnit $23.00.\n| For months there has been much com\n| ment over the possibililitios of none, or\nfew marriages.\nThe last license In Manitowoc coun\nty under the old law was issued by\nClerk Auton to.lolm Warner of Mosel\nand Ella Hogenschuetz of Centerville,\non an application dated December JOth,\nOn January second an unsuspecting\ncouple came In for a license but the\nclerk demanded the irrootn\'s "all\nclear" paper, lie never had heard\nof Eugenics.

The missing girl\'s father\nclosed his business in Marshfield and\ntraced hi3 daughter\'s progress from\nthe moment she left her home. The\npolice were notified, but until\nWednesday morniDg nothing was\nknown beyond that she had been seen\non the train at Merrillan. On Wed\nnesday morning Mr. Engelman re\nceived word from the marshall at Wild\nRose that a girl answering to Miss\nEagelman’s description had taken a\ntrain for Pine River.\nHer father left immediately for Pine\nRiver and found his daughter on the\npoint of leaving for parts unknown\nwith a young woman companion. Tae\nlatter, who has been employed at the\nEngelman home at Marshfield\nand who was twenty-two\nyears of age, unbeknownst to the other\nmembers of the family, had induced\nLillian to promise to leave her home\non some pretense or other and meet\nher at Pine River where the twain ex\npected to “run away”. This attempt\nwas frustrated by Mr. Eogelmsn who\narrived at the rendezvous in the nick\nof time and returned with a penitent\nand, it is hoped, wiser daughter.\nNeedless to say the young girl’s act\ncaused much anxiety to her uncle in\nBaraboo, who met every train since\nher arrival was expected and gone to\nother trouble as well. Her uncle in\nBaraboo states that as far as he knows\nLillian had no reason to leave a good\nhome. In his letter to his brother in\nBaraboo Mr. Engelman does not state\nthe seducer’s name to whom rightly\nbelongs a of the blame.\nSEMI INJURED\nBE HiSE’S HOOF\nAnimal, Uneasy in Black\nsmith Shop, Kicks By\nstander on Skull.\n(Prom Friday\'s Daily.)\nAs Lawrence Luce, son of Mr. and\nMrs. J.

The\nsecond time as Lawrence Luce dodged\nto escape the blow, the hoof\nstruck him on the back of the head\nand threw him, face downward, on a\npile of hammers.

T&ylcr of the econo\nmics department of the University of\nWisconsin, declares it unwise for a far\nmer to invest a large share of his sav\nings in the non-interest-bearing spec\nulative margin which exists in the\npresent price of land. Writing for the\nBreeders’ Gazette, he says there are\nmany reasons for the belief that the\nyoung man had better pay rent a\nwhile longer than buy land at present\nprices unless he \'has at least 50 per\ncent of the purchase price in addition\nto the funds required for equipping\nand operating the farm.

The man\nbought a piece of property eleven\nyears ago and failed to have the deed\nrecorded. Lately he had a chance to\nsell the property and when he was\nabout to make the deal he discovered\nthat for certain reasons his title was\nnot perfect, and in order for him to\nmake the sale it would have to be\nmade so. He consulted local abstract\nagents and he was not a little shocked\nwhen he wp.s set back over SIOU for\nhaving the title made perfect.\nDescended of Roger Williams.\nThe last issue of the Prairie du Sac\nNews contains an obituary sketch of\nRev.

Rooney of Chicago, who has\ninterested himself in the municipal\nChristmas tree plans has sent a letter\nto Mayor Head offering to donate to\nthe city of Kenosha a great pine tree\nto be planted somewhere in the city\nand to be used as a perpetual Christmas\ntree. Rooney furnished the municipal\ntree to Chicago this year. The proposi\ntion is that he will ship the tree to Ke‘-\nnosha with the soil frozen about the\nroots and he holds that if it is planted\nunder such conditions that the transfer\nof it from the northern forests to Ke\nnosha will in no way retard its growth.\nRooney plans to ship trees to seventy\ncities in Illinois, Indiana and Wiscon\nsin.\nMayor Head declared today that he\nwas favorable to the proposition and he\nsuggested that the tree be secured and\nset up in the Market Square Park at\nthe intersection of Church street\nSTARTS ON 810 TASK\nMayor Head Busy Investi\ngating Petitions Asking\nFor Commission Form.\nSMALL MARGIN TO WORK ON\nI\nMayor Declares That He Wil. 1 Rush the\nWork of Investigation and Is»,.t For\nmal Proclamation Just as Soon as Ha\nIs Satisfied With the Petitions.\nMayor Dan 0. Head has started the\narduous task of checking up the names\non the petitions demanding a referen\ndum on the commission form of govern\nment. At the last general election in\nthe city there were 4,010 votes cast for\nall the candidates for mayor and in or\nder to have the question of the com\nmission form submitted to the people\nthe petitions now in the hands of the\nmayor must contain the names of 1,010\nqualified electors of tne city of Keno\nsha. The petitions contain exactly\n1,027 names so that the margin is but\nseventeen and it is probably that this\nwill be reducted by the elimination of\nduplicate signatures. Mayor Head will\nprobably he abb to complete the ex\namination of the names on the petition\nwithin two weeks and if he is satisfied\nthat the number is sufficient he will\nlose no time in issuing his proclama\ntion. Under the law the election must\nbe held within sixty days after the\npresentation of the petition and the\nproclamation of the mayor must be is\nsued within thirty days in order to\ngive time for the preliminaries to the\nprimary.\nThe law provides that should the com\nmission form be adopted by the refer\nendum vote that the candidates for\nmayor and for councilmen must be\nnominated at a regular primary elec\ntion. This primary is to be held under\nthe law which has governed city pri\nmaries in the past. The candidates\nmust silo affidavits of their candidacy\nat least twenty days before the date\nset for the primary and the affidavits\nmust be accompanied by a petition\nsigned by at least twenty-five electors.\nAll petitions must be circulated at\nlarge and under the commission form\nward lines will be entirely w : ped out.\nSome of the opponents to the com\nmission form lave insisted already that\nthe petition is insufficient, they holding\nthat the law demands that the petition\nbe signed by one-fourth of the number\nof electors who voted at the last gen\neral election. T\' iy hold that many\nvotes were cast blank for the office of\nmayor and that the total number of\nall the votes cast was largely in\nexcess of the number received by the\nthree actual candidates. The reading\nof the law appears to be plain and it\nstates that the petitions shall be sign\ned by twenty-five per cent of the votes\ncast for all candidates for mayor. No\nmention of the blank votes is made in\nthe law. This matter has been referred\nto the «city attorney for a decision.\nThe clans have already begun to line\nup for and against the proposed change\nin the form of government of the city.\nMany of the workingmen of the city\nseem to be committed to the new form\nand it has a large support among the\nheavier tax payers of the city. The\nplan is opposed by the men who have\nbeen active in politics as these men\n, seem to prefer the old form.\n“It will take a long while to get\nover these petitions,” said Mayor Head\nin discussing the matter. “There are\na lot of names on them that I have\nnever heard of and I shall be forced\nto refer to poll lists i 1 order to satis\nfy myself that the petitions contain the\nrequisite number of electors. Just as\nsoon as I am convinced that this is true\nI will make the proclamation provided\nby the state law.”\nONE MAN RELEASED.\nJulius Elbi Arrested on Charge of Aid\ning Fugitive Released on Tuesday.\nJulius Elbi, one of the Italians ar\nrested on Monday night on charges of\nhaving aided in the escape of Peter\nCovalla, who was charged with attempt\ned murder, was released on Tuesday\nnight at the order of District Attorney\nAL. Drury. The district attorney held\n; that the evidence was not sufficient to\nhold Elbi for a preliminary hearing in\nthe municipal court. This morning a\nformal complaint was issued for the ar\nrest of James Jendi, who is charged\nwith having furnished the money to\nCovalla to go to Italy. The hearing\nwill be taken up in the municipal court\n■ late this afternoon or Thursday morn\npng.

JANUARY 8, 1914.\nSHOWS BIG INCREASE\nPostal Receipts of Kenosha\nPostoffice Jump $15,000 in\nthe Year of 1913.\nANNUAL HEPOfIT ISSUED TODAY\nPostmaster and Assistants Are Hopeful\nThat Kenosha Wid Supplant Green\nBay as Sixth in List of Postoffices in\nWisconsin in the Annual Report.\nAssistant Postmaster Michael F.\nZeus today .issued his annual report of\nthe receipts of the Kenosha postoffi.ee\nin the sale of stamps and this report\nshows that the year 1913 brought a re\ncord increase in the business of the\nKenosha postoffice. So great is the in\ncrease that the officials of the local of\nfice are of the opinion and entertain\nhigh hopes that Kenosha will supplant\nGreen Bay as the sixth office in the\nstate in the matter of stamp sales.\nKenosha jumped over Sheboygan in the\nreport made by Postmaster Welch of\nEau Claire, a year ago, and it is expect\ned that the statistics of the state ofiices\nto be issued some time this month will\ngive Kenosha another boost. This will\nmake it sixth with Oshkosh fifth\nand Oshkosh is so far ahead of Keno\nsha that it is feared that it will be\nseveral years before the Kenosha office\ntakes an upward step in the list of the\noffices of the state.\nThe increase in the postal receipts\nof the local office over the receipts in\n1912 is more than fifteen thousand dol\nlars, the largest increase ever showm in\nan annual report. The business of the\nparcel post system is reflected in this\nyear\'s business, but at that the busi\nness of the office for December is only\n$450 greater than the bigness of the\npreceding year. • I!LL-the fir#\nten thousand dollar month in the sale\nof stamps in the Kenosha office, the re\nceipts for the month of May passing\nthe ten thousand mark and being more\nthan $3,000 greater than the receipts in\nthe same month last year.\nThe report sent out this year com\npares the receipts of the office over a\nterm of eleven years. It shows that in\n1902 the receipts of the office (postal)\nwere $22,627.88, considerably less than\none-fourth of the receipts during the\nyear just closed. In 1907 the receipts\nhad jumped to $48,996.67; in 1910 they\nreached $63,855.69; in 1911, $75,361.42;\nin 1912, $83,503.38, and in 1913,\n$98,815.86.\nIt will be noted that the increase in\nthe sales for the last year was within\nseven thousand dollars of the increase\nin the five years from 1902 to 1907.\nThe monthly sales of stamps for 1913,\nas compared with 1912, are as follows:\n1912. 1913.\nJanuary $ 7,338.85 $ 8.591.51\nFebruary 5,518.16 7,244.83\nMarch 8,057.43 9,143.30\nApril 6,155.74 9,208,27\nMay 7,026.72 10,189.08\nJune 5,715.59 7,575.21\nJuly 6,812.44 7,768.93\nAugust 7,074.47 6,564.30\nSeptember 6,443.15 8,272.42\nOctober 7,168.76 7,339.26\nNovember 6,439.95 7,016.36\nDecember 9,455.12 9,905.39\nTotals $83,503.38 $98,815.86\nMUST CARE FOR HYDRANTS.\nWater Commission Would Put Fire Pro\ntection in Charge of Department.\nThe water commission at its regular\nsession on Tuesday night took steps to\nput all work in connection with the\nmaintenance of the fire hydrants under\nthe charge of the chief of the fire de\npartment. In order to make this pos\nsible the commission ds planning to in\nstall special taps, which may be used\nby patrons having contracts for street\nsprinkling and after these taps are put\nin the street sprinklers will not be per\nmitted to take water from the fire\nhydrants under any consideration. The\nmembers of the commission spent more,\nthan an hour discussing filtration plans\nbut nothing of a definite nature was\ndone.

F. Bidin\nger and Postmaster Daniel Grady came\nto Kenosha to be the guests of the\nKenosha Council. They came on a spe\ncial car and they came prepared to\ntake charge of all the proceedings of\nthe evening and when they marched in\nto the council hall the officers of the\nKenosha Council yielded their chairs\nto the visitors and all that the Kenosha\nmembers had to do was to spread the\nglad hand and accept the splendid en\ntertainment provided by the visiting\nknights.\nThe Waukegan team had charge of\nthe regular meeting of tht, council and\nafter the work was completefl Mayor\nBidinger was introduced as master of\nceremonies and for an hour the visit\ning knights put on an entertainment\nthat made the Kenosha members of the\norder sit up and take notice.\nThere were musical numbers and\nvaudeville stunts furnished by the vis\nitors and there were addresses breach\ning fraternal greetings by the Wauke\ngan mayor. Postmaster Grady, Louis\nDurkin, John Broderick. John Reardon\nand James Gallagher. Every one of the\nsp<nkcrs had to say. The\nWaukegan visitors urged a closer rela\ntionship between the members of the\norder in Kenosha and Waukegan, and\nspoke of the common interest of all in\nthe advancement of the Work of the\nKnights of Columbus. There were\ntoasts to the order and to its work in\ntwo of the great states in the union.\nAfter the Waukegan men had sang\nand talked themselves tired the Keno\nsha members showed that they were not\nlacking in hospitality and led the way\nto rhe banquet hall where a dinner was\nserved at which covers were laid for\nmore than 150. After dinner was over\nthere was more talking and more good\nfellowship. The members of the Ke\nnosha Council accepted an invitation to\nhave charge of the next meeting of the\nWaukegan Council, and an effort will\nbe made to have at least a hundred\nKenosha knights visit Waukegan on\nthat occasion.\nThis promises to be a banner year\nfor the Kenosha Council and already\nmore than forty applications have been\nreceived. It is planned to arrange for\nthe initiation of a class of more than\n60 members in about two months and\nthis class initiation will be made the\noccasion of one of the biggest gather\nings ever held by the Kenosha Council.\nBIG SUIT IS SETTLED.\nSIO,OOO Suit Brought by Angelo Copen\nAgainst Brass Co. Dismissed Today.\nIn the municipal cpurt this morning\nJudge Randall handed down a formal\norder dismissing the suit brought by\nAngelo Copen against the Chicago Brass\ncompany in which the plaintiff had de\nmanded damages to the amount of $lO,-\n000. The order for dismissal of the sun\nwas based on a stipulation of the at\ntorneys in the case which indicated\nthat the case had been settled out of\ncourt, but no facts in regard to the na\nture of the settlement were made pub\nlic. The attorneys for the defendant\ncompany had filed a demurrer demand\ning the dismissal of the action and the\nmotion was under consideration by the\ncourt when the notice of settlement\nwas received. Copen lost an eye in an\naccident at the plant of the company\nsome time ago.\nOUTSIDERS SEEKING JOBS.\nWorkmen Coming From Other Cities to\nTake Advantage of Prosperity.\nSpeaking in regard to the number of\nmen out of employment in the city, tba \\\nmanager of the Manufacturers’ Em\nployment bureau makes the statement\nthat out-of-town applicants are coming\nin much faster than they can be placed.\nDuring the first two days of the present\nweek the bureau received applications;\nfrom forty-two machinists, thirty\'\nwoodworkers, sixteen painters, besides\nnumerous other tradesmen. AH this\ngoes to show that the crowded condi- ■\ntion.of the labor market is due more’\nto the influx of outside mechanics than i\nL to idle people al home. t\nSEEK REBATE RELEASES.\nCity Attorney Draws Formal Release\nfor Market Square Paving Rebates.\nThe city officials are planning to ef\nfect an early settlement of the question\nof the payment of rebates for paving\non the south side of Market Square by\nthe, railway company and City Attorney\nSlater is bow drawing releases to be\nsigned by each of the property owners.\nThe city has agreed to pay to the prop\nerty owners one-half of the amount re\nbated by the company. It is claimed\nthat every property owner on the south\nside of the square with a single excep\ntion has agreed to sign the release.\nThe exception will probably be taken\ncare,of by the railway company. Mayor\nHead is anxious to have these releases\nsigned and in the hands of the company\nbefore the next meeting of the council\nin order that a final settlement of all\nthe troubles between the city and the\nrailway company may be made at that\ntime.

M. DeDeimar, clerk of the circuit\ncourt of Kenosha county and in charge\nof all naturalization work in this\ncounty, has received the following\nwarning from the department at Wash\nington. It is said that the book re\nferred to in the letter has had a wide\ncirculation io this city and county.\nTo Chief Naturalization Examiners.\nExaminers, Officers of the Naturali\nzation Service, Clerks of Courts ex\nercising jurisdiction in naturalization\nmatters, and others concerned.\nIt has been brought to the attention\nof the department that a publication\nentitled “Syllabus-Digest of Decisions\nUnder the Law of Naturalization of\nthe United States,” purporting to be\nthe work of Jerome C. Shear, chief\nnaturalization examiner at Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania, has been issued and is\nbeing advertised for sale by circular\nletters.\nIn order that the public may not*as\nsume, from the published position and\ntitle of the author, that the contents\nof said publication are, in whole or in\npart, an authoritative expression of the\nofficial administrative view, the depart\nment feels it to be incumbent upon it\nto disavow all responsibility for the\ncontents of said publication. The de\npartment advises all whom it may con\ncern that it alone has authority to de\ntermine whether an official publication\nshould be issued in relation to any law\nover which it has administrative super\nvision, or what, if such publicaton\nshould be issued, its contents should be.\nAll officers of the naturalization\nservice are directed to give this circu\nlar such publicity as may be necessary\nto counteract any misapprehension as\nto the character of Examiner Shear\'s\npublication.\nW.

He de\nclares that to get the greatest ef\n| ficiency from the splendid apparatus\ni provided by the city that more men\n■ are necessary. He seeks to have added\nj men at each of the stations and men\nlto take care of a new station to ba\nbuilt next summer if possible. In addi\ntion to this the chief declares that the\nrebuilding of the fire alarm system is<\n! now a necessity. He holds that during\nI the year alarms have failed to come ini\non account of the condition of the ap\ni paratus at the city hall. His sugges\ntion is that the system be divided into\nsix circuits in order to make it easier\nto locate the breaks. At the present\ntime there are but two circuits. He sug\ngests the installation of a six circuit*\ni repeater and the exchanging nf the\nI nresent two circuit switch board for anj\nj C\'ght circtl L . board. JSit\'h changes\n•Auld no s <J; ,v f or |]j e\ndiate demands of the department, but\'\nalso for the future. He asks that the\ncity provine at once for the installation!\nof eight new fire alarm boxes. The’\ncouncil has already taken up the ques\ntion of the erection of a new station 1\non West Grand avenue and the mem\nbers of the council are divided as to\nthe necessity of such an expenditure at\nthis time but it is not improbable that*\nthe new house will be ordered before 1\nthe end of the present year. No ap\n\' propriation has leen made for the erec-\nI tion of the horse in the annual budget\ni of the citv. tut this is not a bar to the\nbuilding of the house as there was no\nappropriation made for the new build*\ning in the third ward recently com\ni pleted.\nThe annual report of the chief con\ntains a lot of interesting statistics. It\nshows that the value of apparatus own\ned by the city for fire purposes is well\nover $25,000 and that Kenosha has the\nonly complete motor fire service to be\nfound in the state of Wisconsin. The\nreal estate and buildings owned by the\ncity and used for the fire department\nare value at $50,000. The report shows\nthat during the year the department was\ncalled out ninety-nine times and of this\nnumber of calls but twenty were box\ncalls. The total loss on buildings and\nstocks during the year amounted to\n$8,820 and this loss was covered by an.\ninsurance of many times its amount.\nThe majority of the fires attended dur\ning the year were small blazes in which\nthe loss was less than SSO and the larg\nest loss reported was $2,000. This loss’\nwas entirely covered by insurance.\nThe financial report is interesting.\nIt shows thai the cost of maintenance\nof the department for the year was\n$29,946.47. Of this amount $14,712.52\nwas paid out in salaries to the members\nof the department and $7,518.65 was\nexpended for real estate and buildings.\nThe expenses for apparatus during the\nfiscal year amounted to $4,861.74, this\nbeing the amount paid for new appara\ntus after deducting the amounts re\nalized by the city by sale of old;\napparatus.\nIn his report the chief pays high tri\nbute to the work of the men under him,\'\ndeclaring that they have at all times\nbeen faithful to their duties and that\nthey have rendered most efficient’\nservice to the city.\nThe recommendations of the chief\nwill be taken up at an early meeting\nof the council.\nThe jury which heard the ei iilenee ia\nthe suit of John Stocker vs. Adam Win\ntieski and others, reached a verdict late\non Tuesday afternoon finding for the\nplaintiff and fixing the amount he should\nrecover at $65.25.\nThe Kenosha and Racinr high school\nbasketball teams will clash in the first\ngame of the season in Racine on Friday\nevening.

I. Fischer\nin den Abhandlungen der Geographi\nschen Gesellschaft in Wien gegeben.\nHiernach zeichn.n sich besonders d:e\nnördlichen Gestade des Miticlmecrs\ndurch submarine Quellen aus. In\nden Buchten von EanneS und Antivcs\nsowie vor der Mündung des Var sin\nden sich untermeerische Quellen, die\nsich bei ruhiger See durch Aufwallen\nverraten. Auch in der Umgebung r\nRhonemünduiigkn treten submarine\nQuellen und oft in beiräckttichec\nTiefe auf. Die mächtigste ist die von\nPort Miou bei Cassis, sie bricht aus\neinem der 2 Quadratmeter großen\nFelsentore mit solcher Gewalt hervor,\ndaß sie an der Mccresorftäche einen\nStrom hervorruft, der schwimmende\nGegenstände oft über 2 Kilometer weit\nforttreibt. Im Golf von Spezia gidt\nes eine Anzahl zudmariner Queucn,\nvon denen ine so mächtig ist, daß sic\nan der Oberfläche der See einen\nWafferhügel erzeugt, der für kleine\nFahrzeugs unnahbar ist. Zahlreich-\'\nuntermeerische Quellen gibt es längs\nder Küsten von Istrien und Dalma\ntien.\nWenden wir uns nach Amerika, \'o\ntreffen wir auf die auch von Hum\nboldt geschilderten gewaltigen Süß\nwafserqucllcn in der Bucht von Ta\ngua und Kuba. Sie treten mit gro\nßer Kraft an der Meeresoberfläche\nhervor, und bisweilen ergänzen dort\nSchiffe ihren Vorrat an Süßwafler.\nZwischen den Rissen, welche die höh\nlenreichen Bahama-Jnseln umgeben,\nquillt klares, frisches süßes Quell\nwasser empor, das um so reiner und\nkälter ist, je tiffer e- geschöpft wird.\nZur Zeit der Ebbe kann man die\nQuellen deutlich sehen und das Was\nser da schöpfen, wo es aus dem Bo\nden emporsprudelt. In der Nähe der\nInsel Saba in den Kleinen Antillen\nwurde mitten im Meer das Vorhan\ndensein einer bedeutenden Süßwasser\nmasse entdeckt, die in konzentrischen\nKreisen vom Meeresboden aufzuquel\nlen schien. Nahe der Küste von Uuka\ntan gibt es untermeerische Tüßwasser\nquellen, die ihrc Wasser nicht in\nschmalen Becken mir einer gewissen\nGeschwindigteit ausströmen, icnstern\ngewissermaßen ausgebreireicn Seen\ngleichen, die keine merkliche Strömung\nzeigen. Diese Sützwassermaffrn schei\nnen landeinwärts eine große \'Ausdeh\nnung zu besitzen, denn dort befinden\nsich natürliche Brunnen, zu denen die\nAnwohner aus Leocrii durch küu\'ilicke\nund natürliche Schächte bina:steigen,\num sich den Bedarf an Triiikwasser\nzu holen.\nEine merkwürviae hierhin gehörige\nErscheinung sin! stch Lei Reclus.\nIm Januar 18.17 war das ganze\nMeer an der Südspitze von Florida\nder Schauplatz eines acwastigen Süß\nwosser Ausbruch-. Gelbe, schmutzige\nStröme durchkreuzten di Meerenge\nund tote Fi\'che schwammen zu Myria\nden an der Oberfläche. In manchen\nStellen schöpi\'ien die Fischer ibrTrink--\nwasser aus dem Meer wie aus einem\nFluß.

Since\nleaving San Francisco I see they are\nhaving floods and washouts, trains laid\nup and many of the farmers in low lands\nwiped out of house and home in the val\nleys of upper California.\nWe spent two days in Frisco observ\ning what could be seen by tourists, (or\ncountry people as they call us) went\nthrough Chinatown, where they claim\nthirty thousand Chinamen,and of which\nplenty were small ones. We left for\nLob Angeles and Pasadena arriving on\nJanuary Ist, 1914, and from this far-olf\ncity we wish one and all at home a hap\npy and prosperous New Year. We\nwatched the grand parade of the rose\ntournament. There were some grand\nfloats, and many of them. The parade\nlasting over an hour, as we were in one\nplace all that time. In the afternoon\nwe were at the park where there were\nmany races—chariot, hurdle and foot\nracing, high jumping, many things of\ninterest which made the first day of the\nyear a busy one for us. >\nIt is all right and fine at this time of\nthe year and we enjoy being here. The\nfreeze of 1913 was bad for the ranchers\nhere and I am of the opinion farming\nis not in its highest state. There is\nlots of wealth but I am of the strong\nopinion a great deal of it was made in\nthe east. At any rate, Viroqua and\nVernon county looks good to us, and\nnowhere have we seen any more pros-\nBerous country than old Wisconsin.\n(any who have been in the west for\nyears will hardly believe in the advance\nin the enst. but I for one can tell them\nof the modern farm homes, and that\nour farmers of today are on the top\nrow with the cash in their jeans, and\nthe best is none too good for them.\nUps and downs hit most of us some\ntime in life, no matter where we go.\nTb- whole thing in this life is in being\nsatisfied and contented, and this leads\nme to say: be sure you have something\n1 letter than Vernon county before you\nmake any change, as Wisconsin and\nVernon county are to me at the head of\nthe list. Mv wife says to me “be a\nbooster for Wisconsin.” That is what\nthey do in Pasadena.\nYours, J. E. Stoll.\nRoger the Whole Works\nHon. Roger Williams of Hillsboro,\nwho, as justice, lias doubtless married\nmore couplea than any man in Vernon\ncounty, gives notice how to wed with\nout license er medical examination. In\nthe Sentry he advertises:\n“To all those who contemplate mar\nriage in future and wish to wed under a\nsolemn contract, which is binding and\nlawful under the laws of this state, I\nwill draw up for them. The common\nlaw prevails in this state. All that is\nnecessary to do for two people who wish\nto be married is to make b written\nstatement, before witnesses, that they\ntake each other as man and wife. You\ndon’t require any license, medical ex\namination, priest, clergyman or magis\ntrate.”\nDetermined to Hoist Head Officers\nModern Woodmen everywhere are\nsounding the slogan for defeat of pres\nent head officers of the society, who\nwere instrumental in attempting to\nforce the outrageous increase in rates.\nThe local camps will elect delegates at\nthe first meeting in February to attend\na county convention to be held in Viro\nqua later. Camps are entitled to ore\ndelegate for each 26 members. Every\nWoodman in the county should attend\nthe meeting cf his local camp at the\nfirJt February meeting and have a full\nrepresentation at the county convention.\nThe unhorsing of head officers can only\nbe accomplished by moral support and\ndetermination of members.\nChance for More State Inspectors\nIce cream dealers and traders in oys\nters ate now required tn conform with\nanew regulation by the weight and\nmeasures department of the state. Pa\nper ice cream and oyster containers\nmust be filled to a certain height and\nbe marked by a perforated line accom\npanied by the words" Fill to the Mark.”\nThe capacity of the paper bucket must\nalso be plainly indicated on tbe side or\ntop.\nImportant to Threshermen\nAnnual convention of the Wisconsin\nBrotherhood of Threshermen will be\nheld in Madison city January 20th and\n21st. Every tbresherman in the state,\nwhether a member of the association or\nnot, is welcome to attend this conven\ntion and the special attraction on the\nevening of the 20th in the shape of a\n“Dutch Lunch” and smoker. Drop a\npostal card to The American Thresher\nman, Madison, and get your name in\nthe pot.\nToo Sudden for Comfort\nArrival of zero weather for this sea\nson was delayed till January 12th, when\npeople were astonished to arise and find\nthe mercury registering ten below.\nSunday was warm and pleasant, water\nstanding in the roads and automobiles\nmade their rounds as freely as in June.\nThe change was too sudden for com\nfort.\nInsurance Company Officers\nUtica farmers\' mutual insurance com\npany held annual meeting at Readstown\non Friday. Following officers were\nelected:\nPreaidenl—L. C. Schoenbernrer\nVice-President—William Barney\nSecretary—Albert Davick\nTreasurer-J. B. McLeea\nDirectors—O. H. Larson. John Cummins, B.

Er stirbt unter der Sand\nwelle, die seinen Wafferlauf allmählich\nverschüttet, einen Lauf, der für die\nEwigkeit bestimmt schien. Aber lang\nsam ist der Euphrat vor den eindrin\ngenden Sandmassen zurückgewichen,\nund jetzt rüstet er sich vollends zum\nSterben, wie vor ihm die Wunder\nstädte dahingesiecht sind, die sich an\nseinen Ufer erhoben. So verschwin\ndet mit ihm eins der Weltwunder, das\nder Phantasie die lachendsten Bilder\nvon Glück und Wohlstand vorzaubert;\ndenn mit dem Nil zusammen ist der\nEuphrat der berühmteste Fluß der\nErde, der die älteste Zivilisation der\n„heidnischen Welt blühen und ver\ngehen sah." Ja, die jüngsten Ent\ndeckungen haben sogar den Beweis er\nbracht, daß er überhaupt wohl die\nälteste Zivilisationsquelle darstellt,\nweil allem Anscheine nach die Begrün\nder des Pharaonenreichcs vom Persi\nschen Golf kamen. Es war die chal\ndäiscke Technik, die der ägyptischen\nKunst die Mittel zu ihrer Entwick\nlung gab.\nMesopotamien war im Innern eine\nvon der Sonne ausgedörrte Wüste,\nund allein die Kanalisierung des\nEuphrats brachte es fertig, diese\nWüste der Kultur zugänglich zu ma\nchen. Jahrhunderte gingen darüber\nhin, bis das Werk zustande gekommen\nund die Wüste zum Ackerland gewor\nden war. das große Städte erstehen\nund blühen sah. Die Hartnäckigkeit\nund die Kraft des Menschen haben\nhier die Natur überwunden; aber bald\nkam die Zeit der moralischen und po\nlitischen Entartung, die alles verän\nderte. Als die menschliche Energie\nder Verweichlichung Platz machte,\ntrocknete der Boden wieder aus, und\nder Sand nahm vom Wasserlaufe\nBesitz. Unter dem Staubregen star\nben die Wunderstädte dahin und erst\nvor etwa fünfzig Jahren gelang cs\nden Archäologen, die versunkenen\nStädte von Ninive und Babylon wie\nner ans Licht des Tages zu bringen.\nDamit erwachte auch der Euphrat zu\nneucr Tätigkeit. Unzäh\'ige Ladun\ngen von Terrakotten und Statuen\nund Kunsttlümmern gelangten auf\nibm zur Verschiffung. Doch es war\nnur ein kurzes Eintagsleben. das dem\nfteiligen Strome betchieden war. Heute\ntiezt er wieder still, vergessen, und\nrüstet sich endgültig zum Sterben, aus\ndem es kein neues Erwachen gibt.\nf Nordileä or Sroiit, 81.\nNach Fort Bliß.\nSekretär Garrison ordnete die Hefter\nführunz der mexikanischen Sol\ndaten dorthin an.\nWashington.

Tie Alttounfälle haben sich\nin der letzten Zeit derart gehäuft, daß\ndie Richter sich entschlossen haben, Haft\nftraftn an Stelle der Geldstrafe zu\nverhänge, um dem Uedelstand abzu\nhelfen.\nD.u iruM und Mcr.\nProfessor Metschnikow Arbeitet, wie\nbekann\', im Pariser Pasteurinstftrit\nseit langem daran, die Ursachen des\nfrühzeitigen Alterns zu ergründen.\nDie Beobachtung, daß die Lebens\nlange der Tiere im umgekehrten Ver\nhältnis zu der Länge ihres Dickdarms\nsteht, führt Metschnikow zu der Ver\nmutung, daß die im Darm vegetieren\nden Bakterien an dem vorzeitigen Ver\nfall unseres Organismus die Schuld\ntragen. Die von diesen Mikroben\nproduzierten Gifte sollen die Ursache\nunseres kurzen Lebens und der\nKrankheit unseres Alters sein. Tier\nversuche ergaben Degenerations-Er\nscheinungen und sogar Tötung der\nTiere durch solche Darmgifte. Zum\nBeispiel verursacht das Indol, ein\nProdukt der Darmfäulnis, das als\nlangsam wirkendes Gift die bekannten\nAkterserscheinungen hervorruft, vor\nallem die Arteriosklerose, die chronische\nEntzündung der Nieren, kurzum Er\nscheinungen, die für den im Alter ein\ntretenden Verfall charakteristisch sind.\nMetschnikow schlug zuerst, um die\nProduktion solcher Gifte in unserem\nDarm und damit die Altersdegenera\ntion zu bekämpfen, vor. Milchsäure\nbakterien zu verspeisen, da Säure den\nFäulnisprozeß hindert. Diese brau\nchen aber einen zuckerhaltigen Nähr\nboden. Nun dringt der mit der Nah\nrung ansgenommene Zucker nur höchst\nselten dis in die unteren Darmpar\ntien, und die Milchsäurebakterien ver\nmögen daher gerade an der wichtigsten\nStelle den Kampf gegen die Fäulnis\nbakterien nicht aufzunehmen. Es\nmußte danach, wie die „Naturwissen\nschaftliche Wochenschrift" berichtet,\nversucht werden, eine Produktions\nquelle von Zuckerstoff im Dickdarm\nselbst zu finden. In der Tat konnte\nein Darmbakterium ermittelt wer\nden, das Zucker aus Stärke bildet,\nohne die Eiweißkörper anzugreifen.\nDas zuckerbildende Bakterium paßte\nsich den Verhältnissen im menschlichen\nDarm überaus aut an und erwies\nsich absolut unschädlich, und di In\ndol- und Phenolbildung im Darm\nwurde sowohl bei Tieren wie bei\nMenschen bedeutend herabgesetzt. Zur\nUnterstützung der Wirkung empfiehlt\nes sich. Kartoffeln in jeder Zuberei\ntung zu essen. Außerdem ist es not\nwendig. den Fleiscbgenuß soweit wie\nmöalich einzus ranken. Das zucker\nbildende Bakterium lüdet den denkbar\nbc\'\'en Nährboden für das Wachstum\nund die Anffcd\'.nng der Müchffä\'. rQ:k\nterien im Darm. und erst im Zumm\nmcnwirken bien:\',:; erzielt man die\nvolle Wirkung.\nBcrMlicitcr-ft>iuct\nI\nIceue kosincoittraktc sind die l>aupl\naufgabe der Nniked INine I\'Oor\nkers os America.\nIndianapolis, Jnd., 18.

Wie viele wissen aber, was\ndieses Wort eigenNich bedeutet? so\nfragt Adolf Stöbet in einem hübschen\nAufsätze über Volksetymologie, Und\ndoch hat Jeder, der darüber mit un\ntergeschlagenen Armen nachsinnt, im\nwahrsten Sinne des Wortes die\nBretzel vor sich, denn sic ist nichts an\nderes als eine Nachbildung seiner un\nterschlagenen Arme, freilich imKleinen.\nDenn sonst würde sie Bretze heißen.\nBretze ist nach Jakob Grimm „ein in\nGestalt untergeschlagener Arme ge\nbackener Brotring und Bretzel die Ver\nkleinerungsform. Dies Wort ist aber\nnicht urdeutsch, sondern es kam zu uns\naus Italien, und hängt mit dem\nitalienischen „braccio" zusammen."\nDie Italiener nannten nun dieses\nnach beiden Armen geformte Gebäck\nmit dem Plural „bracci", und daraue\nentwickelte sich das deutsche Bretze-\nGebäck. von dem nur noch das Dimi\nuulivum Bretzel erhalten geblieben ist\nEine unverkennbare Verwandtschaft\nhat die Bretzel, die gewiß Verhältniß\nmäßig jungen Ursprunges ist, mb\neinem einfacheren und viel älteren Ge\nbäck, das von seiner Gestalt her einer,\nurdeutschen Namen trägt. Es bilde!\neinen Kreis, einen Ring, und heißt\ndeshalb Ring oder Kring, woraus\ndann genau wie bei der Bretzel die\nBerkleinerungssorm Kringel sich bil\ndete. Ter „Kring" als Gebäck ist\naber noch nicht lange ausgestorben.\nNochum 1780 schrieb z. B, Merck aus\nDarmstadt an Goethe: „Meine Frau\nläßt schon einen Pfingstkringen mehr\nfür Sie backen", und in dem 1865\nerschienen „Namenbüchlein" von Vil\nmar erscheint sogar noch der „Rinken\nbäckcr", der die „Riim-" macht. Es\nist sehr begreiflich, daß sich erst in\nverhälinißmäßig später Zeit die Di\nminutivformen zur Bezeichnung der\nGebäcke herausgebildet haben.

In the\ncase of tardiness, especially in the\ngiades, great care ought to be taken\nby parents to get children started in\ntune and to urge upon them the\nnecessity of being on time. Lately\nat the North school the tardines-i has\nbeen quite general, many being from\nfive to tbiity minutes late, and all\nwithout good reason. The pupils who\nare tardy most often are those who\ncould have reached the school on time\nif they had made an effort The\nteachers have tried to correct the\nmatter, but the co-operation of the\nparents is needed to secure results.\nA child who is reared to come and go\nat his will, will become the victim\nof a tendecy that does much to injure\nhis poseibe success.\nA summary of the records in the\nhigh school shows that for the first\nfour months of the year, thirty pupils\nbave neither been absent nor tardy.\nOf these seven are boys; the best\npercentage of attendance ie in tbe\nFreshman class, wtich out of a\npresent enrollment of thiry-seven has\nfourteen without any loss of time.\nTHE HIGH SCHOOL EXAMINATIONS.\nOn Thursday and Friday. Jan. 22\nand 23, the final semester examina\ntions in the highschool will be held\nThose who have been doing their\ndaily work faithfully bave nothing to\nfear from these tests, but for others\ntbe finals may spell failure, as they\ncount one-fourth with the daily work\nand the monthly tests for tbe\ndetermination of the final average.\nAny pupil who falls below 65 in\neither his tests or his daily work or\nwhose average of test and daily work\nis below 75, fails in his work for the\nsemester and must take the subject\nagain. To seniors, therefore, it is a\nmatcter of graduation.\nA new plan for rbetorical work in\nthe high school was explained to tbe\nstudents last Friday. For tbe second\nsemester of the year, all the pupils in\ntbe school are to be divided into\nfive classes, each of which is to be in\ncharge of a teacher. These divisions\nwill meet separately once each week\nfor their work in public speaking.\nThe same rules will apply to this\ndepartment of work that govern every\nether subject in the school; pupils\nmust attend their division regularly\nand must do their work thoroughly\nand satisfactorily, for records are to\nbe kept, and failure in rhetoricals\nwill prevent graduation just as in any\nother subject.\nFor the seniors the work will con\nsist largely of writing and speaking\ntheir orations; in the other classes,\nit will be the recitation of declama\ntions, debates, extempore speeches,\nand other forms of address.\nRegular drill is to begin next week.\nMr. Frank Meyer spoke before the\nhigh school assembly last Wednesday\nmorning on lack of interest that the\npupils showed in their activities.\nHe condemned tbe attitude of boys\nand girls in school who expected\neverything to be done for them rather\nthan do for themselves, and who com\nplained because opportunities were\nnot furnished them for amusement\nHe recommended strongly that pupils\nget interested in things, and that\nthrough that interest, they get for\nthemselves the things they think they\nought to have.\nFORTY-ONE MILLION\nTO PAY ALL TAXES.\nWisconsin Tax Commission Completes\nTabulation Showing Enormous\nSize of Tax Budget.\nMadison, Wis.—The state tax\ncommission announced today tbe re\nsults of tabulations of Wisconsin\ntaxes for 1914. Total taxes of all\nkinds, state and local, for this year\namount to $41,496,960.21, and the\nstate assessment from which this tax\nwas derived was $2 998,187,705. The\ntax rate is computed at .01387403466.\nComparison of these figures with\ntbcse for last year show an increase of\ntaxes amounting to $7,973,547 30. Tbe\ntotal assessed valuation last year was\n$2,841,630,416, tbe total taxes $33,-\n623,412,919, and the tax rate\n.01183243701. This increase is slight\nly more than two mills, equivalent to\n$2.04 for sl,o’oo of true valuation.\nAn interesting observation in this\nconnection is the fact that the IN\nCREASE in taxes of all kinds this\nyear is greater than tbe TOTAL\namount of taxes paid for the year 1879\n—an interval of 35 years.\nSEVEN TOWNS APPEAL\nTO TAX COMMISSION\nAre Not Satisfied With The Equaliza\ntion Values Made by the\nCounty Board\nThe town of Clifton filed an appeal\nMonday from tbe equalization figures\nreported for tbat town, including tbe\nvillage of Livingston, by tbe equaliza\ntion committee of tbe county board.\nThis makes a total of seven towns in\ntbe county that have so appealed, the\nothers being Marion, Castle Rock,\nBoscobel. Bloomington, Millville and\nNorth Lancaster.\nA, preliminary hearing in these\nmatters will he held at tbe court\nbouse in Lancaster, before representa\ntives of tbe state tax commission on\nFriday, February 6, at 10 o’clock a.\nm., to examine tbe assessments of\ntaxable property in the various towns\nunder dispute and to determine\nwhether such appeal shall be enter\ntained and a review of such equaliza\ntion ordered as provided by statute.\nMr. A. E. James, of Madison,\nstatistician of the state tax cimmis\nsion, has been at the court house\nhere for several days past, examining\nthe records for land descriptions in\n‘the town of Potosi, it being represent\ned tbat there are quite a number of\nerrors in tbe description of some of\ntbe lands.\nFISH AND GAME SHIPMENTS\nPostmaster General Burleson Announces\nParcel Post Rulings.\nThe state fish and game com\nmission last week received word from\nPostmaster General Burleson relative\nto tbe new law governing the ship\ninent of dead fish and game by parcel\npost. The postoffice officials hold\nthat no dead sis hor game which has\nbeen killed illegally may be sent\nthrough tbe mails and tbat tbe laws\nof the state specify tbat postmasters\nshall not accept for mailing any\nparcel containing tbe dead bodies or\nparts thereof any wild animals which\nhave been offered for shipment in\nviolation of the laws of the state ter\nritory or district in which they were\nkilled. Provided, however that the\nforegoing shall not be construed to\nprevent tbe acceptance for mailing of\nany dead animals or birds killed dur\ning tbe season when tbe same may be\nlawfully captured.\nIt was also stated tbat tbe postoffice\nauthorities have the right to inspect\nall parcels placed in their care for\ntransportation, and when tbe packages\nare found to contain dead fish or\ngame shipped out of season, steps for\nthe punishment of the offender can be\nstarted under the federal laws.\nStock Shipments.\nWednesday—J.

I don't claim\nany “state championship. ’ This was\na connty competition. However. I\nunderstand that my record, 133 bushels\nand 38 pounds of corn produced on one\nacre, is the best production of any\nofficially observed. The best previous\nrecord was 13 bushels and 39 pounds\nless than mine.\n[ live in the Town of Eden, and\nwhile we call this “God’s country,”\nthere are many other localities in\nWisconsin, where with similar condi\ntions and equally good seed and care,\nperhaps fully as large yields would\nresult. We had 195 competitors in\nour contest and the general average\nwas so high as to demonstrate the\nwisdom of planting corn in Wiscon\nsin, and more to tbe point tbe wisdom\nof careful selection of seed and giv\ning tbe field tne best possible care.\nMy seed was the Golden Glow variety,\nNo. 12, pure bred. I obtained it from\nJ. P. Bonzelet, and it came from the\nuniversity of Wisconsin Experiment\nstation in 1907. It was planted on\nunusually good clay loam, brought to\na high state of fertility by rotation of\ncrops.\nI selected an acre on the outside of\na forty acre field of corn, and kept\nbusy. Throughout the season I paid\nstrictest attention to the corn, weed\ning it carefully, hill by bill, hoeing\nit by band and also cultivating it\nwith a team plow. The plants never\nstopped growing until sjme of them\nattained a height of ten feet, but\nmany of tbe stalks that made good\nwars were only five feet in height.\nWhen the grain was mature I got the\ncrop into barn in good weather and\ndid tbe husking by hand. I consider\ntbe final results ample reward for tbe\nadditional labor spent over tbe amount\ntne ordinary field gets for I figure the\naverage cost of this corn at only 10*£\ncents a bushel.\nThis experiment convinces me that\nscientific farming is the only proper\nway to get the best respite; 1 have not\nsold tbe crop but it is worth in tbe\nneighborhood of SIOO or $l5O, accord\ning to how much of it is sold as seed.\nThis particular lot is in demand by\nseedsmen simply because it won tbe\nprize, and possibly it will bring a\nhigher price for that reason, but any\n133 bushels of such high quality corn\nwould doubtless bring SIOO which is a\nrather good return on one acre of\nground and aboutsls worth of work.\nMilwaukee Journal.\n—The third anniversary of the\ndedication of the M.

Glass of\nAlabama is not to be seated to succeed\nthe late Senator Johnston, the senate\ncommittee on elections determined\nthat the seventeenth amendment is\nnow in full effect; that no supplement\nal legislation by legislatures is neces\nsary, and that the governor of a state\nhas authority to call a special election\nwhere machinery for such an election\nexists.\nThe senate will pass upon the cc.n\nmittee’s report today.\nIn the Maryland case one Republic\nan, Senator Kenyon of lowa, voted\nwith six Democratic members to seat\nMr. Lee. In the Alabama case only\nSenator Bradley, Republican, of Ken\ntucky, favored seating Mr. Glass. Dem\nocratic leaders expect opposition from\nthe Republican side before a vote is\nreached on the Maryland case.\n“The two cases.” said Chairman\nKern, “were vastly different. In the\nAlabama case proponents of Mr. Glass\nmaintained that the seventeenth\namendment was not in effect because\nthe legislature had not met to supple\nment it with machinery to carry it out\nand that therefore the old laws were\nin force. In the Maryland case, the\nvalidity of the amendment was recog\nnized and effort to carry it out through\nexisting election machinery, a course\nwhich was ratified by a majority of the\nvoters of the state. In Alabama, the\namendment was ignored and in Mary\nland it was sought to carry out the\nspirit of the amendment.”\nGlass was appointed by Governor\nO’Neal to fill the unexpired term of\nSenator Johnston, who died after the\ndirect elections amendment had be\ncome a part of the constitution.\nIn the Maryland case Governor\nGoldsborough called a primary elec\ntion and Blair Lee was victorious. In\nthis case it was declared that the elec\ntion was irregular because it had not\nbeen called by the legislature, but the\ncommittee held that Mr. Lee was en\ntitled to his seat because he was\nchosen by direct vote of the people.\nRelics of Wagner Stolen.\nRelics of Wagner, the great com\nposer, were stolen from the family\nhome, Villa Wahnfried. at Bayreuth,\nGermany, on a recent night.

Ground.\nPaper Written by Ernest Wichern, Son of Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Wichern\nand Read Before the Skillet Creek Farmers’ Club\nThere was clover on the bind laßt\nyear. The first crop was cut for hay\nand the second was cut for seed. The\nnext spring about twenty tons of\nstable manure were hauled on the land\nand plowed in the latter part of May.\nThe ground was harrowed and the\ncorn planted about the first of June*\nThe corn came up iu a few days and\nwfien it was about four inches high it\nwas dragged crosswise as the corn\nwas drilled in. After the corn was\nhigh enough to cultivate I went\nthrough it with the sulkey cultivator,\nthis being about the middle of June.\nAbout ten days later the com was\ngone through again with the same\ncultivator. A week after this we\nstarted hoeing it. The rows were\nplanted three feet, eight inches apart,\nand the corn was very thick in the\nrow. As we hoed it we thinned the\nstalks out to about twelve inches\napart. It took two or three weeks to\nget it all hoed because it seemed hard\nto stick to the job. It it had bsen hoed\nand thinned sooner there would have\nbsen a larger yield.\nThere was nothing done with the\ncorn after this until husking time£\nNumerous\nterritorial\nResidents\nDiscovered\nSince our last report several new\nnames have been added to the News\nTerritorial club.

After the stalks were knocked\ndown the chickens and little pigs\nfound that it was a good place to get\ntheir meals. The Saturday before the\nfair we husked the corn, allowing\nseventy five pounds to the bushel.\nThe corn yield of the country could\nbe greatly increased if the corn could\nbe taken care of in the right way and\nat the right time.\n(Editor\'s Note—ln the corn contest\nconducted by County Superintendent\nG. W. Davies, Walter Klip3tein of\nLoganville look first prize and Ernest\nWichern second. The average yield\nin the United States is 23 bushels,\nin Wisconsin 40 bushels and in the\ncontest 100. The highest in the con\ntest was 122 bushels and the lowest\nabout 82 bushels. Master Wichern\nraised nearly 121 bushels and had it\nDot been for the invaders he would\nno doubt have taken first prize.

Editor and Punisher.\nVALUABLE TOPIC FOR FARMER\nBUSINESS METH\nODS ON THE FARM\nEvery Up-to-date Farmer Should\nTake an Inventory of His\nFarm Now.\nThe Leader has adopted anew feature\nin its endeavor to be especially value\naide to the farmer and will each month\npublish p irts of the Wisconsin Bankers\nfarm bulletin, having been requested to\ndo so by the Farmers & Citizens Hank.\nThe for ming article on Inventories is\nan especially valuable one and should be\ncot out aud saved for reference.\nAn inventory is a statement showing\nin detail the value of land, buildings,\nlivestock, equipment, produce, cash on\nhand and in the bank on the date of in\nventory, together with the amounts of\nall notes and bills that others owe to the\nfarmer as well as those that the farmer\nowes others.\nWhy take an Inventory?\nAn inventory shows, lirst, the farmers\ntotal investment, second, his net worth,\nthird, how much his net worth has in\ncreased or decreased during the year.\nThe total investment is determined by\nadding together th e values of the various\nclasses of property. On this invest\nment the farm must pay a fair rate of\ninterest before there is any return for\nlabor. It is often desirable to know\nhow much of the total capital is invest\ned in horses, land, buildings, etc., and\nby a proper grouping of the farm prop\nerty the annual inventory will furnish\nthe most excellent material for such\nstudy. In case there are no debts, the\nnet worth will be the same as the total\ninvestment; but on farms where there\nare debts these must be subtracted\nfrom the total investment. By compar\ning the net worth of the inventory at\nthe beginning of the year and the net\nworth of that at the end of the year, the\nfarmer can see how much he has gone\nahead or dropped behind.\nBesides furnishing the farmer and his\nfamily a living, the increase or decrease\nin the net worth is what the farm has\ngiven in return for labor and the use of\ncapital. To be able to determine how\nmuch one has gained or lost during the\nyear is of great importance, and the\nvalue of the information alone will more\nthan repay the farmer for the time\nspent on the inventory. It is a common\nmistake for all those who do not take\nthe inventory to look at the amount of\navailable cash as a guage of their busi\nness success. This is a grievious mis\ntake for fluctuations in cash mean prac\ntically nothing. A gain of SI,OOO in cash\nat the end of the year may simply mean\nthat some of the property on hand last\nyear has been turned into cash. On the\nother hand, a decrease of 11,000 may\nmean that what was cash last year ap\npears now in the form of anew build\ning or some other improvement.\nAn annual inventory will also be of\nmaterial assistance in adjusting a loss\nby fire-should buildings, or contents,\nbe burned.\nTime of Taking Inventory.\nFor Wisconsin the time of taking an\ninventory will vary between January 1\nand April 1, preferably March 1. The\nexact date will depend on the location\nof the farm and the type of farming.\nOn a poultry farm the most convenient\ndate is in the fall; whereas on dairy and\nstock farms where there is likely to be\na great deal of feed on hand earlier in\nthe year it might be advisable to post\npone this work until later in the winter.\nFor best results ihe inventories ought\nto be taken on the same date each year,\nand, hence, it is advis: ble to choose a\ndate that is early enough to make it\npossible to get this work done before\nfield work begins even during the years\nof early spring.\nBuildings,\nList and give a valuation to each\nbuilding - The value to be put upon a\nbuilding will depend upon its present\nusefulness, original cost, character of\nbuilding material used, construction,\nstate of repair, age, location, etc. In\ncase of dwellings and barns, handiness\nand sanitation are also points which need\nto be considered. The value must be\nestimated on the basis of the above\nfactors. Statistics show that buildings\nwill, as a rule, decrease in value at a\nyearly rate of from two to four per cent\nof the original cost.\nWater System.\nUnder this heading enter all items\nthat have to do with the water supply\nof the farm and that is a part of real\nestate. Gasoline engines and movable\ntanks would not be included in this\ngroup. Pumps, welis, cement tanks\nand reservoirs, windmills, etc., should\nbe itemized and given separate values.\nThe values of windmills and pumps\nmust be reduced at the rate of from six\nto ten per cent yearly, whereas, wells,\nconcrete tanks and reservoirs can be\nput in the inventory at the same value\neach year.\nLand.\nAfter having obtained the value of\nbuildings and the water system, add the\ntwo totals together and subtract their\nCbe iUatmown meekly Header\nsum from the value of the whole farm.\nThe remainder will be the value of the\nland including fences, woodlots and\ndrainage. Land ought to be left at the\nsame value in the inventory from year\nto year unless there is good reason for\nsome other practice.\nLive Stock.\nHorses and cattle are inventoried in\ndividually. In order that they may be\nrecognized when taking the next in\nventory, they ought to be listed either\nby name or number. The local selling\nprice of horses and cows will help to\ndetermine their value. Age must be\nconsidered. Horses usually rise in\nvalue until the y are about 4 years old\nand then fluctuate with the seasonal\nprice until they are about 10, and then\ndrop off rather rapidly. The value of\nmilk cows will usually rise and fall in\nthe same manner. Hogs, sheep, poultry,\n(unless purebred), are usually inven\ntoried at a certain rate per head, this\nrate being based on market price.\nProduce and Supplies.\nThis includes, hay, straw, grains, corn,\nground feed, binder twine, paints, oils,\nnails, posts, etc. Most of the puchased\nsupplies are on hand in small quantities\nand can either be weighed or estimated.\nWith roughage, grains and corn it is\ndifferent. The amounts on hand of\nthese commodities are found by getting\nthe cubic contents of the bins, mows,\nand stacks. To find the approximate\nnumber of cubic feet in a stack, measure\nits length, width and “over.” To meas\nure the “over,” throw the tape over the\nstack and hold it tight down to the bot\ntom of the stack on both sides. Having\nthe measurement, multiply the length\nby the width, by the “over” and divide\nby 4 to get the number of cubic feet.\nThe number of cubic feet to a ton will\nvary from 320 to 550, depending on the\nkind of hay and how well it is packed.\n500 is ordinarily a safe figure to use.\nEar corn will run between 2y% and 2 l / 2\ncubic feet per bushel, depending some\nwhat on the size of the ears and the\nlength of time it has been in the crib.\nIf one wishes to use 2% cubic feet, the\neasiest method is to multiply by 4 and\ndivide by 10. A bushel of oats, barley,\netc., runs very close to 1 l / 2 cubic feet\nto the bushel. To reduce cubic feet to\nbushel, therefore, one may either divide\nby or else multiply the cubic con\ntents of the bin by 8 and divide by 10.\nSilage will vary from 20 to 60 po mds\nto the cubic foot, depending chiefly on\nthe height to which the silage stood in\nthe silo at the time of filling. There is\nno market price for silage, but for the\npurpose of the inventory it may be\nvalued at 1 3 the market price of hay.\nMachinery and Equipment.\nFor best results, list and value each\nmachine and tool by itself. If one does\nnot desire such detail, minor equipment\ncan be listed and valued in smaller\ngroups, as for instance, carpenter’s\ntools, b\'acksmith’s tools and garden\ntools. But no matter which method is\nused in inventorying minor equipment,\nit is always advisable at the time of tak\ning the first inventory to make a com\nplete list of all tools. For later inven\ntories the value of such equipment may\nbe determined by subtracting 10 per\ncent from the value of the preceding\ninventories and adding the value of new\ntools. At just what value to put ma\nchinery into an inventory will depend\non cost, age, usefulness and efficiency.\nA cinder that cuts 20 acres will last\nlonger than the one cutting 100 acres a\nyear. A machine stored indoors while\nnot used will last longer tnan the one\nleft outdoors, etc. The inventions of\nnew and more efficient machines may\ncause sudden drops in the values of the\nold machinery. As soon as the binder\nwas put on the market the value of the\nreaper was decreased rapidly. Special\ncrop machinery will decrease in value\nsuddenly in case the growing of that\ncrop is discontinued. An example of\nthis would be the sugar beet equipment\nin localities where the growing of beets\nhas been discontinued. The average\nrate at which machinery will decrease\nis not always of much use, but may\nserve as guides. The following are\nsome of the annual rates of deprecia\ntion for the more common machines:\nper cent.\nHay rakes, grain binders, mowers.. . 8\nDrills and seeders, corn planters, corn\ncultivators, gang plows. 7\nHay loaders, manure spreaders 12\nWalking plows and heavy harness... 6\nHarrows 9\nWagons and disks 5\nCash and Notes.\nCash on hand aud in the bank, as well\nas all notes and bills that the farm busi\nness has coming from others, should be\ndetermined aud inventoried accurately.\nBy depositing in a bank proceeds of all\nproduce aud stock sold, and payment of\nall bills bv bank cheek, the annual “pro\nfit or loss” may be more easily ascertain\ned aud annual inventories more readily\nprepared.\nDebts.\nAll debts should be included in the in\nventory. It is advisable to list each\nmortgage ana note and bill separately,\nand to give the name of the party to\nwhom it is drawn.\nValuation.\nThe chief aim in taking an inventory\nshould be to make it show the actual con-\nditions of the farm business. In order\nto make the inventory show this it is\nnecessary to be conservative in all valua\ntions. To be able to place an exact\nvalue on the different items of farm\nproperty is, of course, difficult, but for\ntunately this is not absolutely necessary\nfor the accuracy of the inventory as a\nwhole will not vary directly with the\ncorrectness of the valuation of any one\nitem. If one acquaints himself with\ncurrent prices and tries to be fair in\nhis estimate he is not likely to be very\nfar off on the value of any one item,\nand what mistakes he may make wil\nmost likely offset one another. In case\nof the herd he may rate some of his cows\na little high, but he is just as apt to\nvalue other cows a little too low, and\nthe chances are that by adding together\nall of the values his result would be very\nclose to what the herd would sell for.\nK.

Lewis\nPark Fund and the case of Helen C.\nBoughner, against the city. The former\ncase involved purely questions of law,\nand Judge Grimm has seen fit to decide\nagainst the contention of the city. In\nthe Boughner case the jury, in Judge\nLueck’s court, rendered a special verdict,\nwhich evidently was based on nothing\nbut sympathy for the plaintiff, who it\nappears is crippled and in destitute cir\ncumstances. I fail to find any evidence\nto establish the alleged fact that the ice\nand snow upon which the plaintiff fell,\nexisted for three weeks prior to the ac\ncident, which under the law must be\naffirmatively shown by the plaintiff be\nfore she can recover. Consequently it is\nmy advice that both of these cases be\ntaken to our supreme court, in justice\nto the taxpayers. Both cses present\nnew questions and the secondary liabil\nity, if there is any, of the Barker Lumber\nand Fuel company can be ascertained in\nno other way, having reference, of course,\nonly to the Boughner case. The additional\ncosts in both these cases, if the city lost\nin the supremo court, would be about\none hundred dollars.

It is an actual and\nstupendous condition that faces, aud\nthreatens to outface, the small town and\nthe countryside. A recent report of our\nResearch Bureau establishes that the\nmail order houses carry on annually\ntwenty per cent, as much business as\nthat done by the country merchants of\nthe nation. In other words for every\ndollar spent by the rural consuming\npublic, the town or community, or sec\ntion is taxed twenty cejits. It is virtu\nally a tax on the general resources, since\nthe endless chain element is missing.\nNot a cent of .his money comes back to\nthe spender or to any other member of\nthe community, as does a goodly share\nof all the money spent with the local\ndealer. It is aa economic fact that every\nmail order purchase by a citizen marks\na blow at the prosperity of the com\nmunity.”\nOne feature of the League’s education\nal campaign, according to the statement,\nwill be a through presentation of figures\naiming to show that “mail order bargains\nare, in very many cases, such in name\nonly.” On this point, Mr. Whittier says:\n“Aside from the social phase is the con\nstantly increasing evidence that the con\nsumer, in perhaps a majority of cases,\ncan trade at home and actually save\nmoney on the yeai’s purchases.’’\nBEE-KEEPERS\'\nCONVENTION\nWill Be Held At Madison Tuesday\nand Wednesday.

    tCITY COUHCIL NOUS,

    absent.
    esolutlon of Plumb md Frazier
    unaminously adopted. It ratified
    jKdetail of the committeeâs agree
    â t with the electric company, in
    |Hcted the attorney to apply for a re
    aÃring to enable the stale Railroad
    mjwmission to incorporate the agree-
    Hnt in its order; authorized the coni-
    on electric lights to manage
    H plant temporarily; authorized ihe
    committee to incur some nec
    !iry expenses in priiting and selling
    electric light bonds and instructed
    finance committee not to sell morel
    be bonds than shall be necessary,
    i motion was then made author!/-
    the committee on fire and water to
    to Milwaukee and Kenosha and
    e chief Kratz point out the defects
    advantages of the different types
    notor trucks. Thorison, chairman,
    1 his heart set on this trip. Being
    tious and conscientous above the
    rage he always has to be ââshown.â
    3 vote was, for the junket, 8 against
    The noes were Kapil/, Lippert and
    ierer.
    'he mayor ruled tflat it was an âex
    jrdinary expenditureâ requiring II
    ayes to carry. There was u strained
    pause. Then Thorison came to his
    feet and proposed that the bridge com
    mittee be sent. (This was a short arm
    jab to the solar plexus of his neighbor
    I who recently went on the au
    bridge junket.) Thorison add
    hls committee had numerous
    taake trips of inspection at
    snse of the truck manufactur
    would not consider that and
    the council wanted to spend
    â¢a truck blindly they could not
    snted.
    mtor lire truck proposition for
    ason not discernible has been
    i sinister iniluence for a year
    past. It seems to be creating suspic
    ion and ill-will where there have been
    none for years. Some members are
    fighting it bitterly.
    The necessity for a three-fourths
    vote has prevented the purchase sever
    al times. The proponents caught them
    asleep and slipped the JfiOOO appropria
    tion Into the lodgeu some weeks ago
    specifying it to be for âtire purposes.â
    The antis now assert that this is not
    sufficiently definite to take the purchase
    out of the âextraordinary appropria
    tionâ class. There may be a big light
    over it soon.
    VALUABLE FARM AS
    GIFT STIRSCATO.
    The death of John Meehan of Cato,
    -reported last week, has developed a
    fcurious situation. Mr. Meehan who
    a bachelor, aged 50 has been an
    Hvalid for some time. Early in Nov-
    he gave to the tenant of his
    William Launbrecht, a deed to
    He farm and title to the farm person-
    Hty in consideration of an agreement
    V support the grantor for life and pay
    grantorâs nearest living rela.
    Miss Reddin, of Cato, a niece,
    â BOO upon the grantor's death. The
    farm is just outside the village of Cato.
    Meehan survived this transaction less
    than six weeks. Thus his properly,
    Conservatively valued at SIB,OOO, will
    â  to one not related to him upon the
    â yroent of SIOOO. Meehan had no
    of nearer kin than nieces and
    Although ho had not been
    with these relatives there
    been no ill-will or family feud be
    â¢een them. The farm is further
    pledged upon the bond of Win. Keddin,
    .one of the defendants convicted in the
    treat labor union and; naraile case in the
    federal court at Indianapolis. There
    'are some rumors at Cato of an inten
    tion to contest Launbrecht's possession
    in court but nothing authoritative has
    been made public.

    TRUE SECRET OF POPULARITY
    Qlrl Must. Have torpe Beauty. Grace
    and Intelligence, and Especially
    Radiance.
    What can a young girl, who Is net
    ther a great beauty nor a great heir
    ess, nor one to whom the gods stood
    sponsor at birth, do to make herself
    popular?
    Let us sit down and take our chins
    In our hands and think about It
    A girl must have, at least In some
    small degree, four qualities. There
    are children of fortune who have them
    all, and in abundance, but as from a
    small palette of primary colors a great
    picture may be painted, just so out
    of a few elementary attributes quite
    wonderful results are possible. The
    four qualities of personality are:
    Beauty, grace, intelligence, radk
    ance.
    Beauty may be that of face or fig
    ure, oAAt may be merely an effort of
    beauty through style, charm, or even
    one of the other three qualities fol
    lowing:
    Grace includes not alone symmetrj
    of movement, but all accomplish
    ments In activity, such a a dancing,
    skating, swimming, riding, and also
    any especial gifts, such as a talent for
    music or acting. In other words, the
    girl who has the "gift of graceâ in the
    girl who does things well.
    By intelligence is meant the sympa
    thetic, adaptable quality of mind, rath
    er than that of the brilliant order. Hut
    the one great attribute that crowns
    them all âgranting, of course, some
    gift of the other threeâbut without
    which beauty, grace, cleverness are
    all as applet of Sodomâis the sense
    of enjoyment, the gift of happiness.
    1 dot t think 1 can better define it
    than by tbe word radiance. And best
    of all, radiance is a quality that can
    b( cultivated.
    Beards in Olden Times.
    The Greeks wore their beards until
    the time of Alexander, but that great
    general, probably remembering an en
    counter with bis wife, orderd the Mace
    donians to be shaved, lest their beards
    should g_lve a handle to their enemies.
    Heards were worn by the Romans In
    390 I), C. Th* Emperor Julian wrote
    a diatribe entitled "Misopogonâ against
    the wearing of the chin appendage in
    362 B. C.

    Woman's Reason.
    Women have more of what Is termed
    good sense than men. They cannot
    reason wrong, for tuey do not reason
    at all. They have fewer pretensions,
    are less Implicated In theories, and
    judge of objects more from their im
    mediate and involuntary Impression
    on the mind, and therefore more truly
    and naturally.â Hail'tt.

    The Fortunes of War.â-A soldier
    of the 17th regulars, a native of Phila
    delphia, at the battle of Chickamauga
    was struck with a piece of shell in the
    right eye, then passing under the
    bridge of the nose destroying the sight
    of the left eye, and he is now perfectly
    blind, though in the prime of life. In
    the same action in which he lost bis
    eyesight, he had a father and three
    brothers killed leaving out of a whole
    family only himself and his aged moth
    er.

    captured, within the past seven months,
    four hundred and twelve cannons,
    namely: fifty-two on his advance to
    Vicksburg, three hundred at that place
    and sixty last week before Chattanoo
    ga. Two thousand United Stales can
    nons were stolen from Norfolk at the
    beginning of the rebellion, but if Grant
    keeps on at this : ate he will soon get
    them all back again. Grant mu it be a

    Meade RetreatsâMore Men!â
    Meade sought Lee. He found him
    When he found him he didnât like his
    looks. So lie ran away. Avery brief
    vis-a-vis with the rebel commander
    scared the wits from our commanderâs
    tiead and gave vigor to his heels.
    Meade thinks Lee too strong for him.
    We think Meade was right. He be
    lieved himself forced to run first, or be
    whipped and then run. Doubtless the
    conclusion was well grounded.
    Now here we are againâflat on our
    backs; without force enough to con
    quer another square rod of southern
    territory. To carry out the plan of
    the government at least a million more
    tpen will be required for the field.
    Under the present draft, we do not gel
    enough to till the places of those who
    die in hospital. If the president is in
    earnest, lie will sweep tlie whole first
    class of enrolled national forces into
    the army at once. At the present rate
    of progress, war is fast getting to be
    chronic.

    TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO.
    Charley Peers, Charley Sasse and
    Charley Leveron* constitute a trinity
    of preambulalors on Sundays. A couple
    of weeks ago the three started out in the
    country for a longer walk than usual.
    They took the railroad track until they
    had gone as far as they wished and
    then made for a country mail on which
    they proposed home. â After
    tramping an hour they thought they
    should be in sight of the city but could
    discover no trace of Manitowoc. They
    ipuckened their pace for an other half
    hour and still could discover no trace
    of the lost city. Peers thought some
    one had run away with the pjace; Sas
    se thought there was some witchcraft
    about the thing and Levereniâ. proposed
    they camp out and wait for a relief ex
    pedition. A farmer passed by and the
    three hailed him with. "Say, whereâs
    Manitowocâ?â The farmer thought
    they were guying him and wanted to
    light the crowd. Hasse thought it
    would be a good plan to mount
    and holler as they used to do In olden
    time w hen lost in the woods in hope
    that someone in the city would hear
    and give an answering shout. Their
    queer maneuvers made the farmers
    suspicious and when one of the crowd
    would approach a house to inquire
    about Manitowoc, lie would he chased
    out of the yard with dogs. Peers went
    into the woods having heard at one
    time that persons lost could find ttieir
    way homo by noticing on which side of
    the tree the moss grew. Put it was as
    hard to find moss as it was to lind the
    city. In the meantime the farmers
    were collecting with pitchforks, hoes
    and axes to drive away the three dan
    gerous looking characters who pre
    tended they did not know the way to
    Manitowoc. The trio set olf on a run
    and took anew road. They reached
    the Pranch village by nightfall but
    didnât know the place. One of them
    insisted it was Amigo and that there
    were a few people there who know
    him. Another thought it was Hurley
    as they walked far enough to reach
    that place. The third thought it was
    Depere and pointed to the river as
    proof. They came near having a row
    over the matter but in the nick of
    lime a man approached whom they
    knew. Py round about questions they
    lesrned where they were and hired a
    man to lake them home.
    Now when they go outside the city
    limits for a walk one of âem walks
    backwards so as to keep the city from
    getting awry from them. People who
    meet them wonder why one fellow pre
    fers to walk backward, but the oilier
    i wo explain that he wras born that way.
    They take turns in this task and never
    get beyond sight of the city.

    The state of Maryland is holding sev
    eral educational rallies lo stir up in
    terest in education in order to secure
    legislative action for the improvement
    of the schools of the State and espe
    ciady those located in rural dlstr'cts.
    Rallies are being held in many coun
    ties of the Stale. It is the purpose
    of the State Hoard to hold such rallies
    in every county before the next meet
    ing of the legislature. The State
    Board of Education is especially anxi
    ous to create sentiment which will re
    sult in favorable action Ity the Slate
    legislature on the following mo.-suies;
    1. An increased State appropriation
    for common schools.
    2. A Slate supervisor of rural
    schools ns an assistant to the State Su
    perindent of Public Instruction.
    3. A State-wide compulsory educa
    cation law.
    4. A minimum term of at least sev
    en months for all colored schools.
    . r ). Teacher-training courses in ap
    proved high schools under the auspices
    of the State Board of Education.
    (>. A Slate supported summer school
    for rural teachers.
    It seems strange that so old a state
    as Maryland should lie so far behind
    Wisconsin in these matters; and yet
    the Slate Boaard of Public Affairs bns
    placed Maryland ahead of Wisconsin in
    school efficiency.
    FOLK HIGH SCHOOLS
    IN DENMARK.
    Continuing the education received
    in the elemenlry schools for young
    men and women from 1H to 25 years of
    age and making such provisions as to
    terms that the farm work will boas
    little interfered with as possible is the
    aim of the Folk High Schools of Den
    mark.
    Two courses are offered each year,
    âa four monthsâ course in the winter
    for young men and a three monthsâ
    course in the summer for young wom
    en. Most of these young people have
    completed the work of the elementary
    schools. The schools are located in
    thecountry and are intended primarl'y
    for country youth. The sciences con
    nected with agriculture are taught,
    but the greatest emphasis is laid on
    history, biography, and literature.
    The schools then are not vocational
    schools except in a very broad sense.
    The great object is to awaken the
    intellectual life of the students, lo
    make them ambitious to live efficient
    ly and nobly, and to teach them how
    this may be accomplished.
    It is said that 10 per cent of the pop
    ulation of Denmark goes through these
    schools. Their popularity is attested
    by the fact that they are supported by
    cooperative effort of the people them
    selves; only very small annual grants
    are received from the government.
    â[âhe Folk High Schools are a mighty
    agency :n the life not only of the rural
    communities hut of the nation at large.
    Five members of the Denmark cabinet
    arc from the Folk High Schools, four
    of these are farmers. Many members
    of the lower house of parliament are
    also from these schools. Eighty per
    cent of the officials and managers in
    the cooperative agricultural societies
    and enterprises have attended Folk
    High Schools.
    The results achieved hy these schools
    are a good example of the remarkable
    results which can lie achieved when
    the people are given the kind of educa
    tion which they really need.
