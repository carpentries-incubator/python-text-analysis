## Document/Corpus Embeddings Recap
**Note to instructor:** Run the first code cell below to load the pretrained Word2Vec model (takes a few minutes) before explaining the below text.

So far, we’ve seen how word counts, TF-IDF, and LSA can help us embed a document or set of documents into useful vector spaces that allow us to gain insights from text data. Let's review the embeddings covered thus far...

* **TF-IDF embeddings:** Determines the mathematical significance of words across multiple documents. It's embedding is based on token/word frequency within each document and relative to how many documents a token appears in. 
* **LSA embeddings:** Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is used to find the hidden topics represented by a group of documents. It involves running singular-value decomposition (SVD) on a document-term matrix (typically the TF-IDF matrix), producing a vector representation of each document. This vector scores each document's representation in different topic/concept areas which are derived based on word co-occurences. Importantly, LSA is considered a *bag of words* method since the order of words in a document is not considered. 

##### LSA vs TF-IDF
Compared to TF-IDF, the text representations (a.k.a. embeddings) produced by LSA are arguably more useful since LSA can reveal some of the latent topics referenced throughout a corpus. While LSA gets closer to extracting some of the interesting features of text data, it is limited in the sense that it is a "bag of words" method. That is, it pays no attention to the exact order in which words appear (i.e., beyond co-occurrence patterns in large documents).

## Distributional hypothesis: extracting more meaningful representations of text 
 As the famous linguist JR Firth once said, “You shall know a word by the company it keeps.” Firth is referring to the *distributional hypothesis*, which states that words that repeatedly occur in similar contexts probably have similar meanings. This means that, to extract even richer and more meaningful representations of text, we'll need to pay closer attention to the temporal sequence of words in a sentence. We'll explore how one of the most famous embedding models, Word2Vec, does this in this episode.

### Word embeddings with Word2Vec
Word2vec is a famous *word embedding* method that was created and published in 2013 by a team of researchers led by Tomas Mikolov at Google over two papers, [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546)]. Unlike with TF-IDF and LSA, which are typically used to produce document and corpus embeddings, Word2Vec focuses on producing a single embedding for every word encountered in a corpus. These embeddings, which are represented as high-dimesional vectors, tend to be look very similar for words that are used in similar contexts. We'll unpack the full algorithm behind Word2Vec shortly. First, let's see what we can do with meaningful word vectors (i.e. embeddings).

#### Gensim
We'll be using the Gensim library. The Gensim library comes with several word embedding models including Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText. We'll start by exploring one of the pretrained Word2Vec models. We'll discuss the other options later in this lesson.

First, load the Word2Vec embedding model. The Word2Vec model takes 3- 10 minutes to load. If you can't get the below word2vec model to load quickly enough, you can use the GloVe model, instead. The GloVe model produces word embeddings that are often very similar to Word2Vec. GloVe can be loaded with:```wv = api.load('glove-wiki-gigaword-50')```


```python
# RUN BEFORE INTRO LECTURE :)

# api to load word2vec models
import gensim.downloader as api

# takes 3-10 minutes to load
wv = api.load('word2vec-google-news-300') # takes 3-10 minutes to load 
```

Gensim refers to the pre-trained model object as keyed vectors:

```python
print(type(wv))
```

    <class 'gensim.models.keyedvectors.KeyedVectors'>


In this model, each word has a 300-dimensional representation:


```python
print(wv['whale'].shape) 
```

    (300,)


Once the word embedding model is loaded, we can use it to extract vector representations of words. Let's take a look at the vector representaton of *whale*.


```python
wv['whale'] 
```

Once we have our words represented as vectors, we can start using some math to gain additional insights. For instance, we can compute the cosine similarity between two different word vectors using Gensim's similarity function. 

**Cosine Similarity (Review)**: Recall from earlier in the workshop that cosine similarity helps evaluate vector similarity in terms of the angle that separates the two vectors, irrespective of vector magnitude. It can take a value ranging from -1 to 1, with...
* 1 indicating that the two vectors share the same angle
* 0 indicating that the two vectors are perpendicular or 90 degrees to one another
* -1 indicating that the two vectors are 180 degrees apart.

Cords that occur in similar contexts should have similar vectors/embeddings. How similar are the word vectors representing *whale* and *dolphin*?


```python
wv.similarity('whale','dolphin')
```




    0.77117145



How about *whale* and *fish*?


```python
wv.similarity('whale','fish')
```




    0.55177623



How about *whale* and... *potato*?


```python
wv.similarity('whale','potato')
```




    0.15530972



Our similarity scale seems to be on the right track. We can also use the similarity function to quickly extract the top N most similar words to *whale*.


```python
print(wv.most_similar(positive=['whale'], topn=10))
```

    [('whales', 0.8474178910255432), ('humpback_whale', 0.7968777418136597), ('dolphin', 0.7711714506149292), ('humpback', 0.7535837292671204), ('minke_whale', 0.7365031838417053), ('humpback_whales', 0.7337379455566406), ('dolphins', 0.7213870882987976), ('humpbacks', 0.7138717174530029), ('shark', 0.7011443376541138), ('orca', 0.7007412314414978)]


Based on our ability to recover similar words, it appears the Word2Vec embedding method produces fairly good (i.e., semantically meaningful) word representations. 

### Adding and Subtracting Vectors: King - Man + Woman = Queen
We can also add and subtract word vectors to reveal latent meaning in words. As a canonical example, let's see what happens if we take the word vector representing *King*, subtract the *Man* vector from it, and then add the *Woman* vector to the result. We should get a new vector that closely matches the word vector for *Queen*. We can test this idea out in Gensim with:


```python
print(wv.most_similar(positive=['woman','king'], negative=['man'], topn=3))
```

    [('queen', 0.7118193507194519), ('monarch', 0.6189674139022827), ('princess', 0.5902431011199951)]


Behind the scenes of the most_similar function, gensim first unit normalizes the *length* of all vectors included in the positive and negative function arguments. This is done before adding/subtracting, which prevents longer vectors from unjustly skewing the sum. Note that length here refers to the linear algebraic definition of summing the squared values of each element in a vector followed by taking the square root of that sum:

$ \lVert \mathbf{v} \rVert = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n v_i^2}$

where

- $$\lVert \mathbf{v} \rVert$$ represents the length of vector $$\mathbf{v}$$
- $$v_i$$ represents the $$i$$th component of vector $$\mathbf{v}$$
- $$n$$ represents the number of components (or dimensions) in vector $$\mathbf{v}$$


### Visualizing word vectors with PCA

Similar to how we visualized our texts in the previous lesson to show how they relate to one another, we can visualize how a sample of words relate by plotting their respecitve word vectors. 

Let's start by extracting some word vectors from the pre-trained Word2Vec model.


```python
import numpy as np
words = ['man','woman','boy','girl','king','queen','prince','princess']
sample_vectors = np.array([wv[word] for word in words])
sample_vectors.shape # 8 words, 300 dimensions 
```




    (8, 300)



Recall that each word vector has 300 dimensions that encode a word's meaning. Considering humans can only visualize up to 3 dimensions, this dataset presents a plotting challenge. We could certainly try plotting just the first 2 dimensions or perhaps the dimensions with the largest amount of variability, but this would overlook a lot of the information stored in the other dimensions/variables. Instead, we can use a *dimensionality-reduction* technique known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to allow us to capture most of the information in the data with just 2 dimensions.

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a data transformation technique that allows you to linearly combine a set of variables from a matrix ($N$ observations x $M$ variables) into a smaller set of variables called components. Specifically, it remaps the data onto new dimensions that are strictly orthogonal to one another and can be ordered according to the amount of information/variance they carry. The allows you to easily visualize *most* of the variability in the data with just a couple of dimensions.

We'll use scikit-learn's (a popular machine learning library) PCA functionality to explore the power of PCA, and matplotlib as our plotting library.


```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

In the code below, we will assess how much variance is stored in each dimension following PCA. The new dimensions are often referred to as principal components or eigenvectors, which relates to the underlying math behind this algorithm.

Notice how the first two dimensions capture around 70% of the variability in the dataset.


```python
pca = PCA() # init PCA object
pca.fit(sample_vectors) # the fit function determines the new dimensions or axes to represent the data -- the result is sent back to the pca object

# plot variance explained by each new dimension (principal component)
plt.figure()
plt.plot(pca.explained_variance_ratio_*100,'-o')
plt.xlabel("Principal Components")
plt.ylabel("% Variance Explained")
plt.savefig("wordEmbeddings_word2vecPCAvarExplained.jpg")

```    

![PCA Variance Explained](../images/wordEmbed_PCA-variance.png)

We can now use these new dimensions to transform the original data.


```python
# transform the data
result = pca.transform(sample_vectors)
```

 Once transformed, we can plot the first two principal components representing each word in our list: ```['man', 'woman', 'boy', 'girl', 'king', 'queen', 'prince', 'princess']```


```python
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(result[:,0], result[:,1])
for i, word in enumerate(words):
  plt.annotate(word, xy=(result[i, 0], result[i, 1]))

plt.xlabel("PC1")
plt.ylabel("PC2")
# plt.savefig(wksp_dir + "/wordEmbeddings_word2vecPCAplot.jpg")
plt.show()
```

Note how the principal component 1 seems to represent the royalty dimension, while the principal component 2 seems to represent male vs female. 

## Exercise: Word2Vec Applications
From the above examples, we clearly see that Word2Vec is able to map words onto vectors which relate to a word's meaning. That is, words that are related to one another can be found next to each other in this embedding space. Given this observation, what are some possible ways we could make use of these vectors to explore a set of documents, e.g., newspaper articles from the years 1900-2000.

1. Clustering or classifying documents based on their word vectors. This requires some kind of vector aggregation to yield a single document vector from the numerous word vectors associated with a document. For short texts, a common approach is to use the average of the vectors. There's no clear consensus on what will work well for longer texts. Though, using a weighted average of the vectors might help.

2. Sentiment analysis

3. Categorical search
