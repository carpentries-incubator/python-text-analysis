Words such as *the* and *and* don't necessarily tell us a lot about a document's content and are often removed in simpler models. Stop lists (groups of stop words) are curated by sorting terms by their collection frequency, or the total number of times that they appear in a document or corpus. Punctuation also is something we are not interested in, at least not until we get to more complex models. Many open-source software packages for language processing, such as Spacy, include stop lists. Let's look at Spacy's stopword list."
