    "How is it that Word2Vec is able to represent words in such a semantically meaningful way? The key technology behind Word2Vec is an **artificial neural network**. Neural networks are highly prevalent in many fields now due to their exceptional ability to learn functions that can map a set of input features to some output (e.g., a label or predicted value for some target variable). Because of this general capability, they can be used for a wide assortment of tasks including...\n",

    "Most machine learning systems \"learn\" by taking tabular input data with N observations (rows), M features (cols), and an associated output (e.g., a class label or predicted value for some target variable), and using it to form a model. The maths behind the machine learning doesn’t care what the data is as long as it can represented numerically or categorised. When the model learns this function based on observed data, we call this \"training\" the model.\n",

    "#### Training Dataset Example\n",
    "As a example, maybe we have recorded tail lengths, weights, and snout lengths from a disorganized vet clinic database that is missing some of the animals' labels (e.g., cat vs dog). For simplicity, let's say that this vet clinic only treats cats and dogs. With the help of neural networks, we could use a labelled dataset to learn a function mapping from tail length, weight, and snout length to the animal's species label (i.e., a cat or a dog). \n",

After the model is trained, it can be used to infer the labels of unlabelled samples (so long as they hae tail length, weight, and snouth length recorded).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Compute weighted sum**: The model computes the weighted sum of the input features by multiplying the feature values with their corresponding weights, and summing them up. This is followed by adding the bias term.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Activation function**: The perceptron model applies an activation function, typically a step function or a threshold function, to the computed weighted sum. The activation function determines the output of the perceptron, usually producing a binary output of 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compare with target label**: The output of the perceptron is compared with the target label of the input sample to determine the prediction error. If the prediction is correct, no weight updates are made. If the prediction is incorrect, the weights and bias are updated to minimize the error.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Perceptron limitations\n",
    "A single perceptron cannot solve any function that is not linearly separable, meaning that we need to be able to divide the classes of inputs and outputs with a straight line. To overcome this key limitation of the perceptron (a single aritifical neuron), we need to stack together multiple perceptrons in a hierarchical fashion. Such models are referred to as *multilayer perceptrons* or simply *neural networks*\n",
    "\n",
    "## The multilayer perceptron (MLP)\n",
    "To overcome the limitation of the perceptron, we can stack together multiple perceptrons in a multilayer neural network (shown below) called a multilayer perceptron (MLP). An MLP refers to a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in a feedforward manner. It typically has one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers, with each hidden layer applying an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs. By stacking together layers of perceptrons, the MLP model can learn complex non-linear relationships in the data and make predictions based on those learned patterns.\n",

    "* **Input Layer**: The input layer is the first layer of the MLP and consists of input nodes that receive the features of the input data. Each node in the input layer represents a feature or attribute of the input data. The input layer is not involved in any computation or activation; it simply passes the input features to the next layer.\n",
    "* **Hidden Layer(s)**: The hidden layers are the intermediate layers between the input and output layers. In the above diagram, there is only 1 hidden layer, but MLPs often have more. They are called \"hidden\" because their outputs are not directly visible in the input or output data. Each hidden layer consists of multiple nodes (neurons) that compute a weighted sum of the inputs from the previous layer, followed by an activation function. The number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer are hyperparameters that can be tuned during model design and training.\n",
    "* **Weighted Connections**: Each connection between nodes in adjacent layers has a weight associated with it. These weights are the parameters that the model learns during training to determine the strength of the connections. The weighted sum of inputs to a node is computed by multiplying the input values with their corresponding weights and summing them up. Also referred to as \"weights\" for short. \n",
    "* **Weights**: The weights of each neuron send its (weighted) output to each neuron in the subsequent layer\n",
    "* **Output Layer**: The output layer is the last layer of the MLP and produces the final output of the model. It typically consists of one or more nodes, depending on the specific task. For binary classification, a single output node with a sigmoid activation function is commonly used. For multi-class classification, multiple output nodes with a softmax activation function are used. For regression tasks, a single output node with a linear activation function is often used.\n",

    "### Training algorithm\n",
    "Similar to the perceptron, the MLP is trained using a supervised learning algorithm that updates the weights iteratively based on the prediction error of each training sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The network's weights are randomly initialized.\n",
    "2. **Forward Propagation**: Input data is fed through the network from input nodes to output nodes, with weights applied at each connection, and the output is computed.\n",
    "3. **Error Calculation**: The difference between the predicted output and the actual output (target) is calculated as the error.\n",
    "4. **Backpropagation**: The error is propagated backward through the network, and the weights are adjusted to minimize the error.\n",
    "5. **Iterative Process**: Steps 2-4 are repeated for multiple iterations or epochs, with input data fed through the network and weights updated until the network's performance converges to a satisfactory level.\n",
    "6. **Function Mapping**: Once the network is trained, it can be used to map new input data to corresponding outputs, leveraging the learned weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deriving New Features from Neural Networks\n",
    "After training a neural network, the neural weights encode new features of the data that are conducive to performing well on whatever task the neural network is given. This is due to the feedforward processing built into the network — the outputs of previous layers are sent to subsequent layers, and the so additional transformations get applied to the original inputs as they transcend the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, the deeper the neural network is, the more complicated/abstract these features can become. We call this a **hierarchical feature representation**. For example, in deep convolutional neural networks (a special kind of neural network designed for image processing), the features in each layer look something like the image shown below when the model is trained on a facial recognition task. \n",

    "Recall that the ultimate goal of the Word2Vec method is to output meaningful word embeddings/vectors. How can we train a neural network for such a task? We could try to tediously hand-craft a large list of word vectors that have the properties we seek (e.g., similar words have similar vectors), and then train a neural network to learn this mapping before applying it to new words. However, crafting a list of vectors manually would be an arudous task. Furthermore, it is not immediately clear what kind of vector representation would be best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can capitalize on the fact that neural networks are well posed to learn new features from the input data. Specifically, the new features will be features that are useful for whatever task the model is assigned. With this consideration, we can devise a language related task that allows a neural network model to learn interesting features of words which can then be extracted from the model as a word embedding representation (i.e., a vector). We'll unpack how the embedding gets extracted from the trained model shortly. For now, let's focus on what kind of language-related task to give the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before wrapping up with the mechanisms underlying the Word2Vec model, it is important to mention that the Skip-gram algorithm is not the only way to train word embeddings using Word2Vec. A similar method known as the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) takes as an input the context words surrounding a target word, and tries to guess the target word based on those words. Thus, it flips the prediction task faced by Skip-gram. The CBOW algorithm does not care how far away different context words are from the target word, which is why it is called a bag-of-words method. With this task setup, the neural network will learn a function that can map the surrounding context words to a target word. Similar to Skip-gram, the CBOW method will generate word vectors stored as weights of the neural network. However, given the slight adjustment in task, the weights extracted from CBOW are the ones that connect the hidden layer of neurons to the output layer. \n",

Like with many things in machine learning, the best course of action is typically to take a data-driven approach to see which one works better for your specific application. However, as general guidelines according to Mikolov et al., \n",
    "1. Skip-Gram works well with smaller datasets and has been found to perform better in terms of its ability to represent rarer words\n",

    "## Recap\n",
    "Artificial neural networks are powerful machine learning models that can learn to map input data containing features to a predicted label or continuous value. In addition, neural networks learn to encode the input data as hierarchical features of the text during training. The Word2Vec model exploits this capability, and trains the model on a word prediction task in order to generate features of words which are conducive to the prediction task at hand.\n",

    "In the next episode, we'll train a Word2Vec model using both training methods and empirically evaluate the performance of each. We'll also see how training Word2Vec models from scratch (rather than using a pretrained model) can be beneficial in some circumstances."
