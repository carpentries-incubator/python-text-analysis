However, by tweaking only the output layer, BERT can effectively perform many tasks with a minimal amount of data. This process of adapting an LLM is called __fine-tuning__.\n",

    "We need the following:\n",
    "1. A task, so we can find a model and LLM pipeline to finetune.\n",
    "2. A dataset for our task, properly formatted in a way BERT can interpret.\n",
    "3. A tokenizer and helpers to preprocess our data in a way BERT expects.\n",
    "3. A model that has been pretrained on millions of documents for us. We will only fine-tune this model, not recreate it from scratch.\n",
    "4. A trainer to fine-tune our model to perform our task.\n",
    "5. A set of metrics so that we can evaluate how well our model performs.\n",

    "1. The existing model it uses is a compressed version of BERT, \"distilbert.\" While not as accurate as the full BERT model, it is smaller and easier to fine tune. We'll use this model as well.\n",
    "2. The existing dataset for our task is something called \"conll2003\". We will want to look at this and replace it with our own data, taking care to copy the formatting of existing data.\n",
    "3. The existing tokenizer requires a special helper method called an aligner. We will copy this directly.\n",
    "4. The existing model that we will tweak to accomplish our task.\n",
    "5. A trainer, which will largely use existing parameters. We will need to tweak our output labels for our new data.\n",

    "We have some NER evaluation metrics, so let's discuss what they mean. Accuracy is the most obvious metric for NER. Accuracy is the number of correctly labelled entities divided by the number of total entities. The problem with this metric can be illustrated by supposing we want a model to identify a needle in a haystack. A model that identifies everything as hay would be highly accurate, as most of the entities in a haystack ARE hay, but it wouldn't allow us to find the rare needles we're looking for. Similarly, our named entities will likely not make up most of our documents, so accuracy is not a good metric.\n",

This measure could be gamed, however, by being very conservative about making positive labels and only doing so when the model was absolutely certain, possibly missing relevant entities.\n",
