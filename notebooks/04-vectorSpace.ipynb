    "# Vector Space\n",
    "Now that we've preprocessed our data, let's move to the next step of the interpretative loop: *generating a text embedding*.\n",
    "![The Interpretive Loop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries-incubator/python-text-analysis/main/images/01-Interpretive_Loop.JPG)\n",
    "Many NLP models make use of a concept called Vector Space. The concept works like this:\n",
    "1. We create **embeddings**, or mathematical surrogates, of words and documents in vector space. These embeddings can be represented as sets of coordinates in multidimensional space, or as multi-dimensional matrices.\n",
    "2. These embeddings should be based on some sort of **feature extraction**, meaning that meaningful features from our original documents are somehow represented in our embedding. This will make it so that relationships between embeddings in this vector space will correspond to relationships in the actual documents.\n",
    "## Bags of Words\n",
    "In the models we'll look at today, we have a **\"bag of words\"** assumption as well. We will not consider the placement of words in sentences, their context, or their conjugation into different forms (run vs ran), not until later in this course.\n",
    "A \"bag of words\" model is like putting all words from a sentence in a bag and just being concerned with how many of each word you have, not their order or context.\n",
    "### Worked Example: Bag of Words\n",
    "Let's suppose we want to model a small, simple set of toy documents. Our entire corpus of documents will only have two words, *to* and *be*. We have four documents, A, B, C and D:\n",
    "- A: be be be be be be be be be be to\n",
    "- B: to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be\n",
    "- C: to to be be\n",
    "- D: to be to be\n",
    "We will start by embedding words using a \"one hot\" embedding algorithm. Each document is a new row in our table. Every time word 'to' shows up in a document, we add one to our value for the 'to' dimension for that row, and zero to every other dimension. Every time 'be' shows up in our document, we will add one to our value for the 'be' dimension for that row, and zero to every other dimension.\n",
    "How does this corpus look in vector space? We can display our model using a **document-term matrix**, which looks like the following:\n",
    "| Document   | to      | be |\n",
    "| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| Document A | 1 | 10 |\n",
    "| Document B | 8 | 8 |\n",
    "| Document C | 2 | 2 |\n",
    "| Document D | 2 | 2 |\n",
    "Notice that documents C and D are represented exactly the same. This is unavoidable right now because of our \"bag of words\" assumption, but much later on we will try to represent positions of words in our models as well. Let's visualize this using Python."

    "What can we do with this simple model? At the heart of many research tasks is **distance** or **similarity**, in some sense. When we classify or search for documents, we are asking for documents that are \"close to\" some known examples or search terms. When we explore the topics in our documents, we are asking for a small set of concepts that capture and help explain as much as the ways our documents might differ from one another. And so on.\n",

    "The Euclidian distance formula makes use of the Pythagorean theorem, where $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. We can draw a triangle between two points, and calculate the hypotenuse to find the distance. This distance formula works in two dimensions, but can also be generalized over as many dimensions as we want. Let's use distance to compare A to B, C and D. We'll say the closer two points are, the smaller their distance, so the more similar they are."

    "Distance may seem like a decent metric at first. Certainly, it makes sense that document D has zero distance from itself. C and D are also similar, which makes sense given our bag of words assumption. But take a closer look at documents B and D. Document B is just document D copy and pasted 4 times! How can it be less similar to document D than document B?\n",
    "Distance is highly sensitive to document length. Because document A is shorter than document B, it is closer to document D. While distance may be an intuitive measure of similarity, it is actually highly dependent on document length.\n",
    "We need a different metric that will better represent similarity. This is where vectors come in. Vectors are geometric objects with both length and direction. They can be thought of as a ray or an arrow pointing from one point to another.\n",

The more similar two vectors are in direction, the closer the cosine similarity score gets to 1. The more orthogonal two vectors get (the more at a right angle they are), the closer it gets to 0. And as the more they point in opposite directions, the closer it gets to -1.\n",
