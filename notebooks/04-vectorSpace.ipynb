    "Many NLP models make use of a concept called Vector Space. The concept works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We create **embeddings**, or mathematical surrogates, of words and documents in vector space. These embeddings can be represented as sets of coordinates in multidimensional space, or as multi-dimensional matrices.\n",
    "2. These embeddings should be based on some sort of **feature extraction**, meaning that meaningful features from our original documents are somehow represented in our embedding. This will make it so that relationships between embeddings in this vector space will correspond to relationships in the actual documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bags of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "In the models we'll look at today, we have a **\"bag of words\"** assumption as well. We will not consider the placement of words in sentences, their context, or their conjugation into different forms (run vs ran), not until later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"bag of words\" model is like putting all words from a sentence in a bag and just being concerned with how many of each word you have, not their order or context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worked Example: Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose we want to model a small, simple set of toy documents. Our entire corpus of documents will only have two words, *to* and *be*. We have four documents, A, B, C and D:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A: be be be be be be be be be be to\n",
    "- B: to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be\n",
    "- C: to to be be\n",
    "- D: to be to be\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by embedding words using a \"one hot\" embedding algorithm. Each document is a new row in our table. Every time word 'to' shows up in a document, we add one to our value for the 'to' dimension for that row, and zero to every other dimension. Every time 'be' shows up in our document, we will add one to our value for the 'be' dimension for that row, and zero to every other dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this corpus look in vector space? We can display our model using a **document-term matrix**, which looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Document   | to      | be |\n",
    "| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| Document A | 1 | 10 |\n",
    "| Document B | 8 | 8 |\n",
    "| Document C | 2 | 2 |\n",
    "| Document D | 2 | 2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that documents C and D are represented exactly the same. This is unavoidable right now because of our \"bag of words\" assumption, but much later on we will try to represent positions of words in our models as well. Let's visualize this using Python."

This distance formula works in two dimensions, but can also be generalized over as many dimensions as we want. Let's use distance to compare A to B, C and D. We'll say the closer two points are, the smaller their distance, so the more similar they are."

How can it be less similar to document D than document B?\n",
