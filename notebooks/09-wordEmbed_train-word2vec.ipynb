    "* In general, fastText is considered to be the fastest to train among the three embedding techniques (GloVe, fastText, and Word2Vec). This is because fastText uses subword information, which reduces the vocabulary size and allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, fastText uses a hierarchical softmax for training, which is faster than the traditional softmax used by Word2Vec. Finally, fastText can be trained on multiple threads, further speeding up the training process."
