    "* All three algorithms generate vector representations of words in a high-dimensional space.\n",
    "* They can be used to solve a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "* They are all open-source and widely used in the research community.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differences\n",
    "* Word2Vec focuses on generating embeddings by predicting the context of a word given its surrounding words in a sentence, while GloVe and fastText generate embeddings by predicting the probability of a word co-occurring with another word in a corpus.\n",
    "* fastText also includes character n-grams, allowing it to generate embeddings for words not seen during training, making it particularly useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words.\n",
    "* In general, fastText is considered to be the fastest to train among the three embedding techniques (GloVe, fastText, and Word2Vec). This is because fastText uses subword information, which reduces the vocabulary size and allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, fastText uses a hierarchical softmax for training, which is faster than the traditional softmax used by Word2Vec. Finally, fastText can be trained on multiple threads, further speeding up the training process."
