## Clone the git project

There are a number of files we need to conduct the workshop. By cloning the git repository, you will be able to have a copy of all of the necessary files and functions required to run through the exercises.

1. Click the link below to open the [Github](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-text-analysis) page.
2. Click the green "Code <>" button.
3. Click "Download as zip."
4. Unzip the directory to your desktop or working directory.

## Google Colab Setup
We will be using [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) to run Python code in our browsers. Colab was chosen to ensure all learners have similar processing power (using Google's servers), and to streamline the setup required for the workshop. 

1. Visit the [Google Colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/) and click "New notebook" from the pop-up that shows up
2. Visit [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) and find a newly created "Colab Notebooks" folder stored under MyDrive, ```/My Drive/Colab Notebooks```
3. Create a folder named ```text-analysis``` in the Colab Notebooks folder on Google Drive. The path should look like this: ```/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/text-analysis/```.
4. Upload the "data" and "code" folders that were downloaded from git (inside the "python-text-analysis-gh-pages" folder)  to the "text-analysis" folder you created in Google Drive: ```/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/text-analysis/data``` and  ```/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/text-analysis/code```
5. **Note for instructors**: At the start of each episode, create a new Colab file within the text-analysis folder by navigating to ```/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/text-analysis/``` within [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive), followed by clicking ```New -> More -> Google Colaboratory```
